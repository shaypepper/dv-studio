  'What now should we do? It’s time for us to walk on our knees in prayer, we know God. It’s time for us to share you. It’s time for us to love one another and to realize that every person is valuable. Every person matters to you. We’ve never locked eyes with someone who does not matter to you because Jesus died for the sins of every person. So Father, we stand on that.  We pray for peace.',
