  "A man, well, this is what it's all about, this is why we gather together as a church to be together under the lordship of Christ, calling out for his presence, receiving comfort and hope, and hopefully today a challenge from his word. I invite you to grab your Bibles and turn to Hosea. Chapter six, the Old Testament Book of Hosea. I need to confess to you today that with all this going on this week, I have really struggled with what to preach on this weekend. I had a message planned and was in the middle of writing it as the events on Thursday evening began to unfold. And I certainly don't want to sound super spiritual or sensational in any way. But after talking with Pastor Graham, he confirmed what God was speaking in my own heart, and that is that we need to address head on from a biblical standpoint what we see going on across our nation in these days. And so I really have been praying and seeking the Lord and I trust sensitive to his spirits leading regarding this message today.",
  'I woke up yesterday morning and as I do every single morning, go first to get my cup of coffee and then to an area in the house where I can read the news and read my Bible.',
  'And we had ship the kids off to their grandparents. And so it was gloriously quiet. Thank the Lord for grandparents. And I turned on the news and began to read it. And one of the major outlets, CNN, I want to show you the image here on the screen, had the headline. And in big, bold letters were these words, Who can heal America? And I read the article, I looked at the headline and I thought, this is the title of the message today. And it is the question that I hope to answer in our time together this morning. Who Can Heal America? The article begins by detailing what happened this last week. And the shooting of two African women out in Sterling in Louisiana is still in Minnesota. It then goes on to outline what happened here in our own backyard, the city in which we love. We saw the worst loss of life in public and police life since nine one one.',
  "The article then goes on to quote House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said this. It's been a long week for our country. It's been a long month for America. We've seen terrible, terrible, senseless things, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday, describing the latest scenes of horror and loss. The article continues and it says political leaders, many like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, with crucial elections on their minds, are getting used to tearing up their schedules in the wake of tragedies that shocked the nation.",
  "Yet despite all of the calls for unity, the prayers offered and the platitudes voice, there are few signs yet that any candidate, lawmaker, law enforcement leader or civil rights campaigner has mustered the trust and respect of voters needed to knit a mournful nation together and fresh in the stale national debate on race and violence. Thus, the question is asked who can heal America? And it's a good question.",
  "The world today is asking and looking. And saying to everyone, is there someone out there that can bring hope? Is there someone out there that can bring healing to our country, that can stop all of this violence that we're seeing as a church?",

    text:
      'We must be ready and willing to provide for them and answer. And as Christians, we know what the answer is, right? I mean, the answer is Jesus. He is the only hope and the answer is revival. We need a fresh wind of the spirit of God to move through our country unlike ever before.',
  },
  'I sent a tweet out on Thursday evening as I was watching the news and just expressing how broken hearted I was over the brokenness of the world around us.',
  'And I said in that tweet, Only Jesus can fix this. And I quickly followed it up, saying, this is not a trite saying, this is the truth.',
  'Only Jesus can fix this. And so we need him more than ever. We need revival.',
  "And I believe that we have hope today because revival has happened in our country before, I have in a very small book in my library a book by the name of America's great revivals, and it outlines a series of revivals that swept through our country from the year seventeen thirty four to eighteen ninety nine. And of course refers to the second great first and second Great Awakenings. And under the preaching of men like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield and John Wesley and just a two year span, we're told, stories of three hundred thousand people committing their lives to Christ and renewing their hearts to him just in two years.",
  'It was unlike anything this nation and its young history had ever seen before. The first Great Awakening. And then fast forward one hundred years later, there was a man by the name of Jeremiah Lanphier. He was a layman and he began to be very burdened for the country that he loved. He saw it declining spiritually, and he he wanted a fresh wind of the spirit of God. He wanted God to to come again and return to the country that he loved to bring revival. And so he began knocking on doors. And for three months, he went door to door, home to home, business to business.',
  'And he been in, again, inviting people into a prayer meeting and they decided they would have the first one on a Wednesday at 12:30. And so they reserved a little room in their church. And after three months of inviting people to come, six people showed up to pray that day begging God to move.',
  "They weren't discouraged at the end of that meeting, rather, their prayers encouraged them in their spirits and they said, let's meet again next week. We'll keep getting the word out. And if anybody shows up, this is of God. More people will come. The very next Wednesday, 20 people showed up praying for revival. Fast forward a few months down the road.",
  'Three thousand people.',
  'Showed up to pray. They had to move it out of that little building and even out of that little church and they were meeting and businesses and homes all over New York City.',
  'Six months later, ten thousand people were gathering all over New York City to pray for a mighty move of God, what happened in New York and made his way to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Boston and Boston to Chicago and under the preaching of men like Charles Finney and D.L. Moody, we saw this second great awakening where thousands upon thousands.',
  'Gave their life to Christ and revival swept through our country. And most people point back to that one prayer gathering starting in the heart of one lay person, the authors noted this book says revival has been. And it still is the product of repentance and prayer and dedication.',
  "We are reminded that nationwide spiritual upheavals have begun when God's children minister and laymen have fallen to their knees and sought power from on high. The God of Edwards and Lanphier and Phinney and Moody is our God today. And to that I say Amen.",
  "Hebrews 13 eight. The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. And so when we read the stories of revival, when we hear about the stories of God moving in a powerful way, we see this is what our troubled nation needs. And if he's done it once, I want to cry out with my voice.",
  'Lord, do it again, Lord, do it again. We are in desperate need for a mighty move of your spirit.',
  'And so the question.',
  "But I've been wrestling with in these past few weeks, really? Is as individuals, as a church. Is there a position that we can take?",
  'Is there an attitude that we can foster?',
  'Is there a petition that we need to make, is there something that we can do to bring about this third great awakening and usher in the presence of God to bring about revival that we so desperately need and desire and to bring healing to this country? Is there something we can do? And I believe there is find the answer and the solution to our problem in Hosea, Chapter six.',
  'Starting in verse one, the Bible says this.',
  "Come, let us return to the Lord. It's an invitation. Come, let us together, return to the Lord. If you're looking for a practical takeaway, if you're looking for application, today's message, it's that one word, the word return. It's a powerful word. In fact, I want us to say it together. Return. It's mentioned over a thousand times in the Old Testament, twenty three times in the Book of Hosea alone.",
  'It is a major theme in this Old Testament.',
  'But come, let us return to the Lord. For he has torn us that he may heal us.',
  'He has struck us down and he will bind us up after two days, he will revive us and on the third day he will raise us up that we may live before him. Let us know.',
  'Let us press on to know the Lord. His going out is assures the dawn he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth. Now, I have to tell you, I love the Book of Hosea, a 14 chapters long, you can read it in one sitting. It is rich in historical content, poetic in form, written in the 8th century.',
  "Its message is one that highlights the faithfulness and love of God, Israel at this point in its nation's history. It is is at an historic low mark. The people are depraved. They're living in sin.",
  "They've drifted so far away from God. They don't even know how far they have fallen. In fact, the parallels between Israel then and America now are striking.",
  'Just listen to some of the sins that characterize the nation of Israel and see if any of it sounds familiar. Number one, there is swearing and falsehood.',
  "The Bible says at this time, in nations of Israel's history, there is murder and bloodshed. Adultery and perversion is prevalent, it's everywhere.",
  'Gross idolatry of all kinds, Israel was making foreign alliances with nations that had no business making foreign alliances with. The people are said to be full of deception and drunkenness.',
  "There was a failure to heed God's continual warnings, they're called an ungrateful people, and they were no longer giving God glory for anything. And here's an interesting fact.",
  "As part of God's divine judgment upon them, he begins to send evil kings to rule over them.", // ??
  "Sum it all up, there are no longer being faithful to God. They're no longer living under his rule and for his purposes, and this is where we pick up with.",
  'He was a prophet raised up by God and like all of the Old Testament prophets, he had a message, a verbal message to communicate to the people of God that God so dearly loved.',
  "They were his treasured possession. But unlike some of the other prophets, Hosea wasn't just to preach a message, he was to leave a message out in front of him.",
  'And it was a bold, explicit message. I wish we had time to unpack the tire story, but for the sake of time, I want to share with you three major sins that the nation of Israel was guilty of and that God points out and calls out in this people that he loved so very much. We make our way to Hosie, a chapter for.',
  'And Hosea, chapter four, verse one.',
  "The Bible says this here, the word of the Lord. Children of Israel for the Lord has a controversy. Some of your Bibles say the Lord has a charge. It's a legal term. It's a judicial term. It means a rebuke, a quarrel. It's as if God rolling up his sleeves goes, I've got to fight to pick. And this is what it's over.",
  "He says there's no faithfulness. Or steadfast love. And no knowledge of God in the land. Three major sins that God calls out, he says there's no faithfulness. There's no integrity, there's no fidelity, and as a result, the very foundations of the nation of Israel is crumbling. There's an apathy towards God, there's a complacency toward God, absolutely no faithfulness. He says there's no steadfast love, no loyalty toward God. One of the strongest words we have in the Hebrew language right here, no steadfast love, no loyalty, neither towards God nor towards one another. So there's no compassion, there's no going the extra mile, everyone's looking out for self, no steadfast love.",
  "And he says there's no knowledge of God in this case with the two ideas, one is a personal relationship. Israel had entered into a covenant with God. There was supposed to be a personal relationship there. He was their God and they were his people.",
  "But through the years and the spiritual decline of the country, they have forsaken this personal relationship with God and the other idea is there was no knowledge of God in the first place because as we'll see in a moment, God's law wasn't being taught anymore. So how could there be a knowledge of God? Now you think about where we are as a country. No faithfulness, no steadfast love toward God or one another, no knowledge of God in the land, and when these three sins are present, what is the result? It'll be the same result for us as it was for the nation of Israel. Look at verse two and three. There is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, committing adultery. They break all bounds where these things are present. You're going to have people pushing the limits, crossing all of the boundaries, doing things you could never conceive someone to do. And bloodshed follows bloodshed. Therefore, the land mourns and all who dwell in it languish. And also the beast of the field and the birds of the heaven and even the fish of the sea are taken away. And so look at what is taking place here. He's saying sin affects everything.",
  'It affects your relationship with God, it affects your relationship with others.',
  "In this text, we see it even affects your land. It's the devastating consequences of sin. Of going our own way instead of going God's way.",
  'Now, what I want to do is, for a brief moment, take a step back and.',
  "Ask this question, how on earth did Israel get here again? It wasn't always this way. His treasured possession, he led them by a promise out of slavery and into the promised land, a land of blessing. How did they get here?",
  'Where can you point?',
  "What happened, who is to blame? The text answers that for us, and I think the answer will surprise you look at versus four and five. Yeah, let no one Conten let no one accuse. He says don't point the finger over at this group and say it's your fault over here that you've gone so far away.",
  "Israel, don't point it over here at this group and say it's because of you over here in the decisions that you've made that the nation has gone so far down the road. He says don't they don't contend with one another. Let me tell you who to point the finger to.",
  "He says, my contention is with you Opry's, you shall stumble by day and the prophet shall stumble with you by night, and therefore I will destroy your mother. God places the blame for Israel's demise as a nation first and foremost, squarely on the backs of the spiritual leadership of that day. Says you want to know whose fault it is. It's the prophets. It's the priests. It's the pastors. Put it on them.",
  'I got to tell you, that was not the answer I was looking for in my study this week.',
  "But it's true.",
  'It demonstrates a principle that we see throughout scripture. And that is as the leader goes, so goes the people. Listen, if we want revival to come to America, it must first come to the church.',
  "If it's going to come to the church, it must first come in the heart of the pastors and the spiritual leaders of the DE. If we're not preparing our hearts and asking God for a fresh move of his spirit in our life, you can rest assured it's not going to happen in the country. Now, there's a remnant of faithful pastors that are boldly declaring God's truth, living and upholding his principles and his purposes. And I hope that we here at Prestonwood, a spiritual leaders, I hope that we're in this room. But it is a general conclusion that you can look at the spiritual leadership of a nation and see whether or not that country is healthy or not.",
  'And as a leader goes, so goes the people. Pastors and spiritual leadership, deacons, Bible fellowship, teachers and directors, as we go, so goes the church.',
  "Dad's father's. As you go, so goes the home.",
  'CEOs, business leaders, as you go, so goes your business.',
  'As a nation. As our president and political leaders go, so goes the country.',
  "The leader goes, so goes the people, and if we want America to be hild, it starts with God called men and women living out there calling and integrity and character and faithfulness, because if we don't, it starts a chain reaction that runs throughout society. Listen to our friend, Dr. Tony Evans. Who in an article just released yesterday morning in the Washington Post titled The Article, says this America's current violence can be traced to Christians failures. Listen to the article. Dr. Tony Evans writes, These recent spate of violence, like all of our worldly problems, have happened because Christians have failed to advance God's kingdom, to spread the faith and to do so in a loving, unified way. God must be the days of only pointing fingers at others to fix what they may never fix. Our nation's ills are not merely the result of corruption or racism. Although these are evil, our troubles can also be traced directly to ineffective Christians. One of the real tragedies today is that the church as a whole has not furthered God's light equity in love and principles in our land in order to be a positive influence and impact for good in the midst of darkness, fear and hate. He's stating exactly what Josia is, why are Christians failing to penetrate darkness and advance God's kingdom? Why does the church seem so impotent? And not further in God's light and equity and love, Hosea's says it's because the spiritual leaders are no longer being faithful to God. The spiritual leaders are not heralding truth. The spiritual leaders aren't leading the way. In fact, he says, the only thing they're doing versus five here in the nation of Israel is stumbling continuously. Do you see it? And because the spiritual leadership is stumbling, God says, I will destroy your mother. That is the nation of Israel.",
  'So look and understand the massive implications.',
  "For spiritual leadership to be walking with God. It's why it's so important that you as a church, pray. For the spiritual leaders of this church, not just this church, but.",
  "Spiritual leaders all over America that we would stand in pulpits and we would preach God's word and we would lead congregations to be salt and light, to demonstrate God's love and justice and faithfulness, if we ignore God, if we're unfaithful to God, if we just teach what itching ears want to hear and we insulate ourselves in our holy huddle, staying away from engaging the culture at large, the result could just be the same as that as it was for Israel, where God says I will destroy the nation.",
  "And so I read this and I wonder, is this what we're seeing played out today? We are paying the price.",
  "Because the spiritual leadership has not and is not doing their job of proclaiming and living out what God's word clearly says that we're destroy there in the second part of verse five, it's an interesting word. It means to lay waste to.",
  'To ruin, to cut off.',
  'Is the picture of a violent disaster that creates utter destruction.',
  "Wiping it out. So when we say. We need to return to the Lord. There's a sense of urgency that goes along with it.",
  "Hosea, for God points the finger at the spiritual leaders, as a result, it's run through society and say, a Chapter five, he begins to blame national leaders. You see this here, this Opry's pay attention to the House of Israel. Give Erro House of the King. How he judges them both, he says judgment is for you.",
  'And so what do we do?',
  'I mean, we read in Chapter six this the takeaway.',
  'We are to return to the Lord, we are to return to the Lord, we are to return to the Lord.',
  'But herein lies the problem.',
  "Because even when the nation of Israel wanted to return to the Lord, they didn't do it in a way that honored him. And so look at what happens in versus four and five their deeds. They don't permit them to return to their God for a spirit of whoredom is within them. And they know, not the Lord. The pride of Israel testifies to his face. A spirit of whoredom for the kids in the room.",
  "Think cheating on a test, not being faithful, not being true. He says, you say you want to return to the Lord, but your deeds don't allow it in, your pride testifies to your face.",
  "This is our problem. It's pride. Now, if revival is going to start, it starts in the pulpit with the spiritual leaders and then it starts in the church.",
  "I mean, we can't.",
  "Expect revival to come to America if it doesn't happen in our hearts, if it doesn't happen in our lives. So as Christians, this is a call to say, you know what, we've got a term from the pride of doing our own thing and going our own way, and we've got to humbly seek the face of God. More on that in a moment. But as a nation, as a people, if we have any hope of healing as a nation and as a people, we have to turn from our pride. It is testifying to our face. It is our pride that is separating our nation from God.",
  "Pride testifies to our face, we don't need God. We're rich, we're wealthy, we're comfortable.",
  "We don't need God, 20 million dollars in debt, we'll just keep spending, we don't need God. In our schools, nineteen sixty three, let's take prayer out of the schools, we don't need God there, we're only God and our pride testifies to our faith.",
  "God, we don't need God to define and determine life, we get to make those choices and our pride testifies to our faith. We don't need God.",
  "Freedom of religion, which is a right that we have as Americans to take our faith and what we learn here and know here and love here, use it in the marketplaces and businesses and schools where now we're saying we don't need freedom of religion, freedom of worship. You come and do what you want to do within the four walls of the church. But don't take it outside of there. We don't need God.",
  'And in this hour, Pride is testifying to our base, what is at the root of this senseless shootings?',
  'What is at the root of hatred and prejudice and racism?',
  'Is it not pride testifying to our face? And so when tragedies like Thursday evening happen, we often hear where is God?',
  'We need God.',
  'But until we humble ourselves first as Christians, as a church and then as a nation, till we humble ourselves and return to him in a way that honors him, we will never find him. Look at four six, one of the scariest verses in the Bible with their flocks and herds, they shall go to seek the Lord.',
  "Where is God? Let's find him. They shall go to seek the Lord, but they will not find him, for he has withdrawn from him.",
  "That's what pride does. That's what going our own way does. God repellent. He knows our heart, he knows if we're just offering lip service. And pride and pretense is a stench in its nostrils, so much so that if we begin, if we don't turn returned to him in a way that honors him, look at verse 15 of chapter five. The first part, God says, I'll return again to my place. It's a picture of a lion who's gotten up to roar. And just returns to its den.",
  'So how do we. Return in a way that honors God.',
  "How do we return in a way that gets God's attention?",
  "We have to implement Josia Chapter five, verses 15 through Josia, Chapter six, verse one, because until we do, there will be no awakening. There will be no revival. So this is what we are hoping for, this is what we're pleading for this morning, there's hope in this verse.",
  "How do we return in a way that honors you, God, look at the second part of verse 15, we must acknowledge our guilt so God returns to his place until until we acknowledge our guilt, until we seek God's face and in our distress, earnestly seek him.",
  "This is the recipe, this is the posture, this is what we must do if we want and move the spirit of God, if we want our country healed, this is what we must do, this type of returning to God where we acknowledge our sin and seek his face and earnestly seek after him this type of returning to God, he will never turn away. In fact, he will come running to us. It's the scriptural promise of Jeremiah twenty nine 13 that whoever seeks me and seeks me with their whole heart, he will find me. This is a seeking after God with our whole heart.",
  "No one is confession. That's what we must do. He says, acknowledge your guilt.",
  "It's time to confess our sins individually, corporately, and then we stand in the gap as Christians for our country. We must confess our sins first, John one nine. If we confess our sins, he is faithful. And just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, revival begins in our heart. It's been defined as nothing more, nothing less than a new obedience to God. And this obedience begins when we begin to confess not just our actions, but the inclinations of our heart. We get along with the Lord by the power of his Holy Spirit. We say, God, search me. Is there racism in my heart?",
  'Is their prejudices, their hatred, Lord root it out.',

  "We must forsake our pride and confess our sense that once again, God turns and hears our cry. Secondly, consecration, he says, seek my face. That's an urgent call to serious prayer and holy living. We are to seek the face of God. Second, Chronical seven 14. If my people again, it starts with us. If my people will call on my name who are called by my name, will humble themselves, starts with humility and pray and seek my face consecration and turn from their wicked ways. I will hear from heaven and will forgive them and I will heal their land.",
  "We must humble ourselves and seek his face. One of the action steps that Tony Evans calls for in his article regarding what can churches do in times like these? He says, we need to call for solemn assemblies where we gather together in prayer and fasting. We ask for God's manifest presence to emerge and our culture. You know what's beautiful this has been in the heart of our pastor is why he called for just a few weeks ago. When fall Wednesdays begin that we will gather together to pray with a solemn assembly. And when wed start in the fall will come in this worship center we're working right now and how that's going to relate to other programs that go on within the church. But we're calling the body together to pray and to fast and to ask God to move, not going to do it unless it starts in our heart. This is a result calling and crying out to God. God, I want to desire what you desire, want to hate what you hate. I want to love what you love. I'll go wherever you go. Now, consecration does not mean you have to have it all together. Listen, the invitation days you come just as you are.",
  "It just comes with an honest heart. This has got I'm tired of going my own way, doing my own thing, here's the blank check. Fill it in. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. My yes is on the tape. That's consecration that's returning that God honors. Thirdly, and finally, commitment. We confess, we consecrate we separate ourselves where we we we live holy lives and then we commit to this, he says. In their distress, they earnestly, earnestly, earnestly seek me the personal relationship here in their distress.",
  "This has been a distressing week. You know what we usually do in times of distress. If you're like me, you stress.",
  'Are we get fearful?',
  "Oh, we throw up our hands and say, man, this world's going in a different direction, there's no use and pray and there's no use in doing good deeds of no use and being salt like my I can't make a difference. So you just throw your hands up and you insulate yourself. You put your guard up. No one can be trusted.",
  "Ansted godson's don't do that earnestly, seek me like the Sonus earnestly desire me like Jacob, who said I'm going to the prayer room and I'm not letting go God until you bless me, until you speak to me, until I meet with you. This is a returning that honors the Lord. That's why on the invitation of Hosea's six one, it's come, come, let us return together.",
  "Come and Jesus puts a face on this invitation to come. How often do we see in the scriptures, Matthew. Eleven twenty eight. Come to me all you who are tired and have heavy burdens and Jesus said I'll give you revelation chapter twenty two. All who are thirsty, all who have thirst. Indeed to be quick come to me and I'll satisfy your thirst.",

And he raised from the dead, demonstrating that he has the power to forgive our sin and restore us to a right relationship with God. And if he can raise from the dead, he can heal America. And so we come to the Lord. We return to a way that honors him. Look at this. Let us return to the Lord. Let us this is corporate us together. This is a call for us together. Return to the Lord, for he has taught us a picture of a predator shedding shredding its prey with its claws that he may heal as he has struck us down, that he will bind us up.",
