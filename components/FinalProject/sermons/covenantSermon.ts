  "I believe this morning that the times that we are living in, God has perfectly prepared us for the trouble that we see, the pain in our nation, the hatred, the disappointment, the injustice, the violence. The morning, so we either bury the dead and move on or we rise up as the body of Christ and say we're here to make a difference. If, in fact, there are 300 plus million professing Christians in America, we can make a change.",
  "I want you to open your heart today and prepare to hear from my heart and hopefully the heart of the father, what he has in mind I want to talk to you about. And there's no ego in this title, but it's taken totally from the word of God.",
  "And I want to talk to you about how to stop the violence in America. God is concerned about violence. I don't know if you understand this or not, but that's what got the world flooded in the Old Testament. The Bible says that God looked upon the Earth and saw that it was only filled with violence. And he said, I'm going to drown at all and start over. God is concerned about violence.",
  'Father, I pray that you be with us today for this word. I pray that you open our hearts, our eyes of understanding our ears to hear and send us out of this place as change agents in the earth.',
  'Because for this hour, we came into the world in Jesus name. You may be seated. God bless you.',
  'I want to welcome our other campuses and I want to say how proud I am and how thankful for the leadership that our pastor Stephen here in this House and the entire team and all of our campus pastors have shown in our leaders true colors come out in times of crisis and we are in a time of crisis.',
  "I came home today to be here with you because I believe it's important for me to be here in our city during a time of crisis.",
  "I was on vacation and I was fulfilling a lifelong dream, or at least for a number of years, I took my boys, Steven Stacey Thate, one of my grandsons that was available to go to Alaska for a fishing trip. And we were having a great time. And then these things begin to happen. And I actually had plans to come back down and fly through. I did a conference for Pastor Gordon last week in Seattle and then we went from there to Alaska. So I was coming back to Seattle, Las Vegas, Flagstaff was my flight pattern. And so when I was on the way from Seattle to Vegas, I just decided, I'm not going on to Flagstaff, I'm going to go to Dallas. I need to be in my city.",
  "This is the city I love. This is a city of my calling. And I believe it's the place of our anointing and authority. I believe the place God has called you is a place he gives you authority.",
  "And we're here to bless the city. We're here to call some things in to order in the spirit, because enough is enough.",
  "And these demons of violence, we don't fight flesh and blood.",

      "We fly. We fight high principalities that are in the middle heavens who want to destroy everything that's good. And one of the reasons that Dallas is under attack specifically is because Dallas is a tremendous city of destiny. Some of the greatest revelations and revivals in history emanated from Dallas. Dallas is a special place to God. Some of the greatest churches in the world are in Dallas, this being one of them, man.",
  },
  'And when the enemy detects now this is true for you as individuals as well, when the enemy detects anointing on your life, then he targets you for destruction.',
  'And so what was it, 1962?',
  "Almost 50 years ago, President Kennedy was assassinated in the streets of Dallas. Why? Because the devil wants to mark a city of destiny with a smear of shame. And so now he's done it again with the senseless murder of five police officers and two civilians and others who hang in the balance and with their families and loved ones who sit at their bedside at Baylor Hospital or right where we said with Steven, I pray for them today that God give us healing and mercy and covering a man. I want to talk to you today from the word of God about how we can end the violence in America because we are on a dangerous path. No. One, I want you to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that there is us and them. When I say us and them, I'm not talking about the haves and the have nots. I'm not talking about the whites and the blacks.",
  "I'm not talking about the upper echelon in the lower level. I'm talking about the kingdom of God and his light and the kingdom of darkness and those who do not understand there is a difference between us and them. And as long as there is the kingdom of God in the midst of darkness, it's like a cold front and the hot air from the Gulf meeting, that's where tornadic activity happens. So the kingdom of light is here to confront darkness, whatever form it takes. That is our calling.",
  " Number two, Jesus said that we are called to be salt and light. Now, that doesn't mean as much to us as readily to be understood as it did in that day. But in that day, there was no refrigeration, no ice. And so everything had to be preserved that was going to be eaten later. And they primarily use salt or drying techniques for doing that. So salt was their major preservative. Please hear me without the kingdom of God. See, there are people in Dallas today that think the church is the problem in the enemy. The reality is, if it weren't for the people of God and his mighty church in the earth, we would already have descended into total destruction and chaos. It is the power of God through the church that holds back darkness. So we are seen with no salt in Jesus day. Any meat that was taken that you intended to feed your family with later would rot. And the same is true in the spirit today. Without the Kingdom of God holding back darkness and preserving the will of God in the Earth, society will rot at the core.",
  "And secondly, he said, you are light lt is a Revealer you can't see without light, you stumble in the darkness without light.",
  'Has your wife ever change the furniture on you? And you came in late that night and you thought you knew where that coffee table was. And you know, Jesus knows what you said under your breath when you hit your skin on that coffee table.',
  "He'll forgive you. But but we got to see. You see, and here's the thing, please. My teaching is very practical. And I want you to get I see in images and I want you to get this.",
  "If you have no light in the room and you're not familiar with the surroundings or where the furniture is, you don't need to feel your way around and move all the furniture. The furniture placement is not the problem. The problem is you can't see when the light is turned on, everything becomes clear and you can navigate easily through a room that you can see in where people have light.",
  "We're not confused. We're not distraught. We're not discouraged.",
  "The feeling in the spirit right now is like Jesus must have felt when he was on trial before pilot and pilot said to him when he didn't answer a question readily enough, don't you know that I possess the power to take your life or give it back to you? And Jesus said, nobody has that power.",
  "That powers in my hands alone for this time, came into the world, and that's what we have to recognize as the kingdom of God, we're here at the right time, in the right place for the right reason.",
  "And we can do this. We're reconcilers. We're reconcilers. We can fix anything through the power of the cross.",

      "Thirdly, it doesn't thrill me to say this, but I believe it will get worse before it will get better. I don't think we've seen the end of what we're seeing now. And one reason is because there's not enough of us that are yet activated to many of us still comfortable.",
  },
  "I want to talk to you about a concept that can change the world and there's already enough of us to do that. And if I can just send you out of here today from our five campuses streaming out into society with this concept, we can begin to change the world.",
  "Psalm Chapter 23, the famous chapter, The Lord is My Shepherd, verse six says, Surely your goodness and unfailing love I'm reading from the new living translation will pursue me all the days of my life and I will live in the House of the Lord forever. This terminology your goodness. And I think the King James original sin is your goodness and mercy. One translation says your goodness and loving kindness. This is the word in Hebrew. And this is one of those places where one word can cover a number of English words. And that's what it does in this verse, this verse. And I'm going to teach you some Hebrew real quickly.",
  'ECD has said has said is the word that they are attempting to translate adequately in English.',
  "So they had to say in verse number six here, your goodness and your loving kindness or your tender mercy. Both of those phrases, all of those phrases are contained in the singular Hebrew word has said, has said means God's unfailing. Never ending covenant of love, given in acts of kindness to those who don't even deserve it, see deserving, it has nothing to do with God's acts of love.",
  "Now, what I'm about to say, as one who studied the Bible and theology for four decades is a mouthful. I know, but I want you to hear this because I'm not being dramatic. This may be the greatest concept of the attributes of who and what God is of any of them in the Bible. The word has said in the Old Testament, in Hebrew is written hundreds of times. This may be one of God's greatest attributes and one of them that he most wants us to have.",
  "What is a has said, I said to a Jew, is an act of kindness given to a stranger, someone who's got a flat tire on the side of the road, someone who can't pay their bill because their credit card was turned down and you pay for their meal. It's an act of kindness, Undeserved has said.",
  "And the key here is David said, your has said will pursue me all the days of my life. See, the the the difference in. And somebody asked me, what's the difference in his said in agape, agape love has said contains. And as I said, it takes a lot of English words to share. It has said contains the very definitive and important concept that it is an action. Word has said you don't sit around in your recliner and has said has said is something you do for somebody undeserved just out of an act of love.",
  "But out of that can come tremendous healing. As I mentioned, I was flying home and I came through Las Vegas and I spent the night there. A couple of the boys stayed with me and then they drove on to Flagstaff because we start our airborne retreat tomorrow. We've got 50 pastors, kids that we're bringing in from across the nation to minister to in a retreat in the mountains for a week. And so that starts tomorrow. And that's what I was going there for. Kathy and Amy and the rest are already there. And so they went on to Flagstaff and I flew here.",
  'And so we had dinner in a restaurant night before last.',
  'And that I particularly like if I go through there, I love this Mexican restaurant. And we were there. And next to me at a table was a couple. I left the table and I came. When I came back to the table, I noticed them and it was an African-American couple, middle aged.',
  "And I looked at them and he looked at me and smiled and I smiled back. And I had that sense that I knew him, but I didn't know where from.",
  "And and and I really knew that I probably didn't know him, but he felt familiar. Do you ever get that feeling like. I think I know them, but I don't know where from. And so I just stopped at their table and I said, how are you doing? And they said, we're doing good. And I said, I'm sorry. I just I loved your smile. And I I felt like I knew you. And he said, well, we've never been to this restaurant before. And I said, well, I've been a couple of times, I really like it. And so we talked for a minute and he said, well, this is my wife and I was. Twenty ninth wedding anniversary. We're celebrating tonight. And just out of my heart, I said, congratulations. That's wonderful. Would it be OK if I pay for your dinner? The waiter was right there. I said, put it on my tab. And they said, No, no, you don't have to do that. I said, no, please let me.",
  "I didn't know these people. Tears came in this man's eyes.",
  "And he said to me, I told him what I did, Noel. And he said to me, Pastor, I'm in law enforcement here in Las Vegas and I work with gangs. And there is so much trouble and fear and misgiving.",
  'And you just made my day.',
  "And I said, here's my joy.",
  'So I sat down, finished our dinner, they were leaving before we were, and he came over and just sat down in my booth and scooted me over and said, my wife wants to take a picture of you and I.',
  'Can I have your picture?',
  "And I've got a friend that's a has said I don't know them, I just want to do something now I know we all want some deep revelation, but let me share something with you with the troubles we're seeing in the nation right now. And there are some reasons for that that I want to touch on. But if there are more than 300 million professing Christians that believe in Jesus in this nation, what if we today sent 300 million people out of churches all over America with a heart to look for an opportunity to do something for someone as an act of love, undeserved?",

  "An interesting concept also that I love about has said is that there are many passages in the Bible that in God's mind, he ties has said to the morning the AM first thing in the morning he ties, has said.",
  "And every morning together, for instance, you probably know the famous verse and lamentation chapter three, I think it's about verse 23 that says For your mercies are new every morning. That word Merce's translated is has said so. God says, here's what I want you to know.",
  'Children, your has said is renewed every morning.',
  "Now go out there today. And what you did last week is not today's has said every morning has new mercy.",
  "Now isn't it amazing that we can look at and read that verse and we always apply it to our own personal need for fresh mercy instead of applying it to the fact that there's somebody?",
  "That God's going to lead me to.",
  "But I can be their blessing and my Hishem from God is fresh this morning. You can't ever give enough of it away to beat God because he's going to make it for you fresh every morning.",
  "So here's what I want to ask you as a part of this message today, would you make a silent vow in your heart to say, father, in my mourning, quiet time or devotion, I want to start my day with saying whatever the Fresh has said is for me today?",
  "Let me be sensitive to that one that you want me to touch in to help, because he is an act of love undeserved, it's not somebody you see if somebody has to earn it.",
  "Is it really love at all? You know, the levels at which we love are just not at the Christlike level yet, the apostle Paul and Peter and the early apostles were writing things like this, pray for those in authority, even your emperor and Rome. This was when they were under the unbelievable persecution and domination of Nero, who was the worst emperor of Rome ever had for Christian persecution. Impulse's pray for him. Pray for him.",
  "I'm not going to pray for, you know, you pray for it, you pray for all those in authority, you know, if I apply this now, every time we see an unfortunate and unjust, a disappointing, a disgusting outpouring of some kind of authoritative violence against a citizen. Our temptation is to do other than pray for the one who did the shooting or the killing or the destroying.",

  "You know, here's the deal with gun control. I mean, I'm a gun guy. I own guns. I think we should I think it's OK. But I don't know how you legislate this, but nobody with a heart full of hate ought to be allowed to own a gun. So let's put that on an al.",
  "Before I sell you this, I don't care if you're a lawman or you're a street thug, do you have a heart full of hate? If you do, I'm not selling you this gun because guns have never hurt anybody. That didn't have a heart full of hate and a heart full of hate just makes a gun a more convenient way to do it quicker than what you would do over time if you have a heart full of hate.",

  "I'm not responsible for the Christians in the whole nation, but I am responsible to speak to this house and I challenge you in the name of Jesus, that if we would begin to go out of here looking for opportunities to love somebody, to do someone, an act of kindness or love, even undeserved, this is a study for another time. I'm out of time. But listen to this. The first time has said was ever used in the Bible. You know where it was early in the days of Genesis, God created his highest creation, Adam and Eve.",
  "He had plans for them to be fruitful in the whole earth. They weren't even out of the garden yet and they had already fallen into total disobedience and sin. And what does the Bible say? The Bible says in the cool of the evening, as he always did, God pursued them in the garden. He knew they were feeling bad and shameful and trying to cover themselves with fig leaves and all that. And what did God do? God slaughtered animals, made firs to cover them and pursued them until he found them and clothed them. And that's the first place in the Bible has said is used, has said is an act of love that is deserved. Has said is an act of love that is an earned and let me give you one more word of instruction and caution. Please hear this.",
  "If we start as a larger church like we are, if we fall into the dangerous trap of the church, having to build a program and a committee and a department and an office, every time we talk about doing anything to help the community, then that's a black hole that we can never satisfy because we're going to be adding more staff and having more meetings than we are loving people. There was a lady one time I came to the church. This was years ago and our receptionist at that time was over here and she was just about in tears.",

  "And I want your church to take them some groceries. And I said, OK, you're part of our church, I am. I said, well, where did you meet these people? She told me. I said, well, let me kind you ask it kindly ask you something. Do you have a car? I do. Do you know where a grocery store is located?",
  'I do.',
  'Then do you have enough money to buy a sack of groceries for someone that is in need? Because maybe that was the reason God let you find them with that need.',
  "And and here's the thing I said, if you feel like that loving someone who is hungry is satisfied by you calling the church and chewing us out because we haven't run to give them a sack of groceries, then we'll never be the church.",
  "I said, Dear sister, you are the church. We can't build a program for every need we have to leave out of here by the thousands today. Loving people meeting needs waking up with fresh Hassad every morning.",

I don't have a life outside of you.",

He said, if you save your life, you'll lose it if you lose your life. For my sake in the gospel, you'll find it. That's the way it reads in English. It loses something there. Because in the original, here's what Jesus said.",
