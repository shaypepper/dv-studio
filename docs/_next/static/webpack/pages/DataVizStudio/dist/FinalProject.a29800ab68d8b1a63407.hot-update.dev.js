The reality is, if it weren't for the people of God and his mighty church in the earth, we would already have descended into total destruction and chaos. It is the power of God through the church that holds back darkness. So we are seen with no salt in Jesus day. Any meat that was taken that you intended to feed your family with later would rot.
