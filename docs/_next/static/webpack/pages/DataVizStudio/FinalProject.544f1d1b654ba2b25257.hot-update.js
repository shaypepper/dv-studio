We meet here, and we discuss, and we're not offended, and we point them to truth. We believe that if something is true, no amount of scrutiny can affect it.\", \"If you're here this morning, and that is what is going to serve you or if you want to understand more about the hope we have, when we're done, what you can do is walk right out of here. If you will go out those doors and up the steps, we have a smaller gathering area up there where we do a lot of weddings and smaller funerals. It's called our Chapel. There will be a group in there to facilitate that in the next 20 to 30 minutes with you.\", \"The rest of us are going to stay here, and we're going to go to work. I ask you to just turn to the folks around you and to use that prayer guide to pray now for about 15 minutes, and then we'll pull you back together. Please don't leave. This is what the church does. The army of God marches on its knees. It is time to go to work and pray for our city.\", \"If you don't know how to pray, just read what is written in the group you're in. Sit in a group and listen to others pray. God is not judging your words. He's welcoming your heart as you turn to him. Would you turn to one another right where you are? We'll spend the next 15 minutes praying, and then we're going to celebrate the justice of God that is filled with mercy. Let's pray.\", \"Lord, I know you will be mad at me in heaven for probably interrupting the conversations you're having with your people more than anything, but we just bring it to one conversation with you right now. I thank you, Lord, that in your sovereignty and in your omnipotence, you heard every single thing we said.\", \"Lord, it wasn't so much about us trying to get you aligned with our will. That was all about trying to get us aligned with your will. Father, we want to seek your face. We want to turn from our wicked ways, and we want to be your people.\", \"Would you help us even in the remaining time we have together and the things you have given us to remember you and respond correctly to you? Would you just burn in our hearts the gospel truth so we can go and take that and heal hurting people? Thank you, Lord, that you have prepared us for such a time as this. We love you. In Jesus' name, amen.\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'fightAgsintInjustice',\n  text: \"You know, I have purposed with my friends, many of whom are African-American leaders in this community, that if they're looking for a race war, they're not going to get it in Dallas, Texas. We're going to love each other here, and we're going to live in one accord, and it's going to start with the church. It's going to start with people who understand why other people are still angry, and we're going to listen to them, and we're going to take to them the hands and feet of Christ, fight against injustice of all kinds.\"\n}, \"One of the things that has been shocking to me here through the last couple of days is how much it has meant to my African-American brothers and sisters when I have just told them I understand their pain or I want to understand more. It shouldn't be a surprise to me because my wife, every time I listen to her, says, \\\"I appreciate the way you're listening and living with me as the Bible commands, in an understanding way.\\\"\", \"When you understand somebody, that doesn't mean you justify their sin. It just means you listen to their pain. When men are in pain, and when women are in pain, they go for all kinds of directions to try and find healing. When we try and have legitimate healing through illegitimate means, it's going to cause more problems.\", \"When we meet God-given desires in God-forbidden ways, it causes more problems. Here is what I have learned again. I have to do a better job of telling people I love that I love them. I met with all of our police officers this morning who are on our campus who are with us and sprinkled about.\", \"I just said, \\\"Would you guys forgive me? Would you forgive me that it takes times like this for me to circle back up with you and tell you that I love you, that you put your lives on the line with me, that you don't know on a regular basis how grateful I am that you guys are out there working the hours you are to keep safety and order in our city? Would you forgive me that it takes that much for me to tell you I love you?\\\"\", \"I told my black friends that. I told my wife that. I hope you guys know that I don't tell you guys enough how much I love you, how grateful I am to be a part of this church and to watch the way so many of you guys were actively on the front lines of caring for others. Last night, with me in the city worshipping and engaging people further and further out, inviting your friends to be here.\", \"I want to tell you I love this church. I love the church of Jesus Christ. I love the church of Jesus Christ I saw at Concord and Oak Cliff Bible and other churches spread out throughout this city, south, north. I love my friends at The Village who love Jesus. I love people because God has loved people, and because God has loved people, I don't let them get lost in their sin. I speak truth to them.\", \"If you guys are committed to truth or committed to love, love without truth is not loving, but truth without love won't be heard. We have to be people who do not back away from truth. We have to be unafraid to love. We have to do a better job. I need to do a better job of telling people who I have loved for a long time, \\\"I love you.\\\"\", \"I haven't told them I don't. I have to tell them I do. One of the things God has given us is a constant reminder of his love for us. Every time we eat a meal\\u2026 This was Jesus' intention. He said, \\\"As often as you have bread\\u2026\\\" In every ancient Near Middle East meal, you had bread. \\\"As often as you break that bread, do it in remembrance of me.\", \"Be reminded that I haven't forgotten you, that I do love you, that I am a just God, and I do strongly have an offense against sin, but remember that I love you and that I have given myself for you. God is going to make me who knew no sin to become sin on your behalf that you might become the righteousness of God in me.\\\"\", \"It was the fulfillment of all of the Old Testament Scriptures, that the Messiah, when he would come, would be a suffering servant who would give himself. All of us like sheep have gone astray. Each of us has turned to his own way. The Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him, and that King Jesus wants us to be reminded of how much he loves us every time we break bread.\", \"Periodically, we do it this way through little elements in Communion, but I want you to know that Jesus wants you to remember him every time. He's the Bread of Life which gives you strength. He is the refreshing, if you will. His blood being poured out for you is the means through which the new covenant was cut, that you can be reconciled to him.\", \"We're about to celebrate that. If you're here, and you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, not that you know the story but that you have personally said, \\\"Jesus died for my sin. Apart from what Jesus did, there is nothing I could ever do to be righteous in God's eyes.\\\" If you have trusted in Christ, you are welcome at this Table.\", \"I want to warn you. If you take a symbol of God's wrath being poured out against sin in a superficial or fleeting way, it isn't a blessing to you. All you're doing is saying, \\\"I deserve judgment because I acknowledge God is holy and I am not. I acknowledge that he made provision for my sin, but have never dealt with it personally.\\\"\", \"Jesus invites all people who know him personally to come to the Table. What we're going to do is we're going to pass out the elements. I would love you to receive them. Then we'll take them together. As you do, I want you to be reminded of the goodness of God. He knows that this is a world that is overcome with trouble. I know you're worn. I know you're weary, but he has walked these roads for us. He calls us to the healing Table of his Son. Receive the elements, and then we'll take them together.\", \"That's why Jesus said, \\\"Are you worn out? Are you weary? Are you heavy laden? Come.\\\" In a city that God is speaking to through the megaphone of pain\\u2026 Man, we're worn out by all this death and this killing and this despair. We should just say, \\\"Come. Come to the God who is life. Come to the God who will teach you a better way. Come to the God who will heal. Come to the God who will bring you together, where there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, male and female, barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man, and make you one.\\\"\", \"Our country has been trying to heal from some of those things for a long time. We become one, and we come to the one who made us, and we reconcile to him through the means which he has given us to reconcile. There is only one name under heaven by which men must be saved, and his name is Jesus Christ, whom God has displayed on the cross as an instrument that received his wrath so God's justice could be satisfied in an appropriate way.\", \"In this is love, not that we love God but that God loves us and gave his Son to be a sacrifice for our sins. Just hours before Jesus went to that cross, he gathered his disciples together and said, \\\"Listen. As often as you break this bread, just do it in remembrance of me. This is my body which is broken for you.\\\" He wants us to do the same.\", \"In this little memorial way, if you have a relationship with Jesus\\u2026 I don't even care if this is your time you profess him, that you personally know that you are a sinner before a God who takes justice seriously. By the kindness of God, he takes mercy seriously, so he has offered you a better way, and that better way is through his Son, whose body was given for you. You can take and receive this, the body of Christ, broken for you.\", \"At that same meal, afterward, he took up a cup. It was a specific cup, that Passover seder. He said, \\\"As often as you drink this cup, do so in remembrance of me.\\\" It was a cup of anticipation, of hope, of celebration. It was, \\\"This isn't over. It's not all darkness and death. There is redemption. There is joy that is going to come.\", \"One day, there will be a provision that is going to have your sons and daughters all know me, and everybody will be forgiven. You will be one with me.\\\" He said, \\\"That new covenant is about to be cut right now through my blood which is about to be shed.\\\" The blood of Christ shed for you.\", \"I love our little evangelical community church tradition. We have grape juice and not wine because it just makes your mouth happy when it hits it. Doesn't it? Man, listen. If it is true, if this crazy story is true, that God is not angry at us in our sin\\u2026 He goes, \\\"Are you guys done fighting? Do you want to get along? Do you want to be healed? Come to me. Learn to love as I have loved. Give your lives for one another. Understand each other. Be reconciled to me that I can reconcile you to one another.\\\"\", \"Man, that ought to make us really glad that that is possible. We see it happen. The world ought to look at us. We're a church of 70 different nations of origin, members of Watermark Community Church. Did you know that? We get along. We're in community together. We care for one another. We sing together.\", \"The world ought to go, \\\"How does that happen? How can the nations unite?\\\" The answer is Jesus. He's the Prince of Peace. That's what's going on here. Our mark is love. We have to tell each other we love each other, but we only do that out of an overflow of the love we have received. Let me remind you of that love right now. Let's sing it to one another. Stand with me.\", \"What a perfect way to end. \\\"Bear your cross as you wait for the crown. Tell them all where the treasure is that you've found.\\\" That's what we do. That's what the church does. God has shouted to them right now in their pain, and they're wondering, \\\"How do we do this?\\\" Literally, media outlets across the country, people around the city are saying, \\\"What do we do? How do we do this?\\\"\", \"You have to tell them about the treasure you've found, how we can come together in peace. Guys, you do know this. Black lives matter. You do know that, right? You know that gay lives matter. Did you know that gay lives matter? Gay lives matter. Did you know that people with gender dysphoria matter to God? Did you know that God hates broken sexuality? God hates broken racism. God hates broken marriages.\", \"God hates divorce, but did you know that divorcees matter to God? Did you guys know that? They ought to matter to us, every single one of them. When you talk to your homosexual friends, they think you hate them. When is the last time you went to one of your friends and said, \\\"I just want you to know that I love you, and God loves you, and I love you enough to tell you that I think what you're doing is destructive, just like maybe me in my heterosexual perversion. It's destructive, but God loves me, and this is what he has done for me in my brokenness.\\\"\", \"You get to go carry that message. God is not angry about our sin. He hates sin, and if we identify with it and not with him, we will be judged along with sin, but if we hate sin with him and go, \\\"God, what must we do to be delivered from this body of death?\\\" he says, \\\"Come. Come to the cross where my love was poured out, where my wrath was already poured out. Find forgiveness and reconciliation to me, and be my healing balm of grace. Go and love as you have been loved. Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.\\\"\", \"The anger of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God, but the anger of God has accomplished salvation for us, poured out in his Son, Jesus Christ. If you know it, would you go preach it? If you have never understood that before, would you come? Would you come and let us tell you about it? There is a little section in the Watermark News. You can just check that. We'll follow up with you this week. You can come right here. Would you go, church? This is your time. Rise up. Bear your cross as you wait for the crown.\", \"Have a great week of worship.
