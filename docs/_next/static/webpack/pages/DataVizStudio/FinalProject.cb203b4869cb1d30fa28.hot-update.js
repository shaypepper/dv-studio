If you don't have a Bible with you, there should be a hardback black one somewhere around you. If you'll grab that, we're going to be in one verse today. In fact, we're going to get one sentence today, Maika, chapter six, verse eight. And so what I want to do with our time together today is I just kind of want to step into the fray of this past week knowing that there are a lot of landmines there and there are a lot of things that could go wrong by doing this.\", \"And yet I think that the people of God need to enter this dialog with the type of conversation that I hope ultimately will bring healing to souls and and really will allow us to operate as the people of God in the midst of continued tragedy on all sides of this festering wound in the American landscape. It was a tale of two weeks for the pastoral staff here at the village. And and I'll try to explain that. I got back into town on Wednesday morning and really didn't know. I don't take my phone with me or things like that on vacation. So I was completely unaware of the two shootings that had occurred. And so when I got back in and saw the news, I just immediately made a couple of calls to African-American friends of mine to just tell them I was sorry and to just kind of mourn with them. And so really a in between Wednesday at noon and Thursday at 2:00, I had held in my arms and wept with three grown African-American men and then left my office to start my weekend.\", \"My weekend. Thursday night is my Friday night. Friday night is my Saturday Saturday. I'm here with the village church, getting ready to preach to services that night.\", 'And then so I went home Thursday and then of course, we saw what we saw Thursday night. And so all day Friday for us then turned to loving and weeping with law enforcement officials. In fact, we were invited down to Dallas. And so Josh and I went down to Dallas and got to be a part of the the prayer rally there at Thanksgiving Square, praying for the mayor, praying for the chief of police and having a lot of conversations with our law enforcement officials.', 'And and something that struck me and that Josh and I talked about on the way home is that both the black community and the blue community, they tend to feel very similar things in these situations, although that might not know what he might not like that I say that.', \"And what I mean by that is my conversations with my African-American friends have involved sadness and rage, a type of despair and my conversations with law enforcement officials. Their their emotions are sadness and rage and a sense of despair and so on. On the way back home, Josh and I were talking about how do we ever get out of this mess? I mean, goodness sakes, it's just been going on forever. When will this ever end? What's the way forward? And so I mentioned the verse that we're about to read and then we begin to talk about the implications of this verse. And here's what I want to do. I'm I'm going to talk for another eight minutes and then I'm going to invite out to join me on the stage four of our African-American brothers and sisters. Three of them are on staff. One is a deaconess here at the village church. And what I want you to do is hear from them and not me today. And so we're going to do a little panel. But I want to set up the panel like this. Micah, Chapter six verse. A lot of theologians would say that the whole of the Old Testament could be summarized in this sentence.\", \"And here is the sentence. He has told you, oh, man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you? But do justice to love, kindness and to walk humbly with your God.\\\" Now, that sentence looks like a preacher's dream. Done it. I've got three points right there. I mean, how easy is I don't even have to come on. Three points there. There do justice, love, kindness. Walk humbly with God. I'm a poem and a funny illustration away from being done.\", \"And yet that's not what's happening in the text. See what's happening in this text.\", \"Is the explanation that in order to do justice, which is action, you must love kindness and you must walk in humility. And if you cannot walk in humility and you do not love kindness, there will never be any justice, regardless of the color of your skin. And so Josh and I on the way home began to talk about the power of empathy and really the belief that out of the scriptures kind of extrapolating and distilling from the scriptures what the Bible would teach around justice is that progress in the arena, in the arena that we're stuck in this week will only go as far as our empathy will carry us, will only go as far as our empathy will carry us. And so I want to set up our panel like this in order for us to grow in empathy.\", \"It will require humility. You can't be empathetic if you are proud. Right. You just can't do it. Like if you think you're awesome and you've accomplished I mean, you even if your way is right and you can't you don't need to learn anything. You know what you need to know, then you can never be empathetic because you're so dadgum awesome.\", \"I mean, you're just so amazing in your worldview, so amazing and you're so right, how could you ever feel deeply about anybody other than those with your exact same story? It requires humility.\", 'Second thing it requires is presence. You will never develop empathy on Facebook or Twitter.', 'It requires proximity, it requires proximity, you develop empathy by having deep, legitimate relationships.', \"And then lastly, empathy and developing empathy requires sacrifice to enter into the pain of others, to enter the sorrow of others, to enter even the rejoicing of others means there's a part of me that dies. And yet I come out more human over time. I come out more human over time. Now, two things I want to set up for our panel. One is some theological truths. And second is some historical facts. And then I'm going to just invite our panel out and let them introduce themselves.\", \"Here's some things we embrace as Christians. So if you're a Christian, you believe this. All right. And so here's we believe in the Imago day that all men and women were created equal in dignity and value and worth by a creator that we are far more valuable as humankind than anything else in all of the creative order so that a man with Down syndrome who cannot take care of himself but needs care is more valuable than Secretariat ever was because he has been made in the image of God. And Secretariat was a horse, a stunningly beautiful, powerful horse, but a horse, not a man.\", 'A man has more value.', \"Doesn't free up, man, to be cruel, it frees up man to be the image of God. We believe that we believe that sin has infected all of mankind. We believe that their salvation from said we believe as Christians and progressive sanctification. So let's talk about that, because when you start to pull on that, it begins to set up the framework for our discussion today. What we mean when we talk about progressive sanctification, when we quote verses like he who began the good work in me will be faithful to complete it. We're making a confession that we are not yet what we will eventually be. That's what progressive sanctification means. It means that when God sees me, he sees me by the blood of Christ as holy and blameless and spotless in his sight. But my practical experience is that I am not wholly not blameless and not without fault. In fact, if you know me, you know this isn't true. And if you know yourself, you know this isn't true. What makes the gospel so stunning is that as broken, as idolatrous. And it's foolish as I am. God loves me, cherishes me, likes me and sees me as perfect, is not biding his time for me to get more mature before he loves me. And on top of that, he uses me despite my brokenness.\", \"He's not waiting for me to be perfect before he uses me, in fact, oftentimes he'll use my imperfection for his glory.\", \"That's crazy. So let me pull it down to this, then.\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: 'Because there are no perfect people and we are all works in progress, that means all systems and structures created by men are intrinsically faulty and broken.'\n}, 'Because there are no perfect men, there can be no perfect systems, there are systems that are better than others, but but there is no no ship in culture, society, government rule, regulation that does not have cracks in its hull.', {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: \"They don't exist because there's no such thing as a sinless man outside of Christ. There are men seen by God as holy, spotless, blameless in inside, but we're broken and we build broken things. And if you're a Christian, this is our world view right now. With that said, let me walk through some historical facts. These aren't my opinions. These are historical facts. There has been no ethnic group that has borne the brunt of the brokenness of systems and structures in the United States of America like our African-American brothers and sisters have, we do not have equal historical place in America.\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: 'History shows on repeat the betrayal of African-Americans by the very systems and structures that were meant to protect them from the Emancipation Proclamation to 40 acres and a mule that was very quickly taken back from African-Americans and handed back over to former plantation and slave owners, only to institute a new type of slavery on end to Jim Crow, to the Great Migration, into the civil rights. ER, we have nothing in our history but that the systems and structures built to protect and defend have oftentimes bore the dark edge of their blade on African-Americans.'\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: \"I just don't see how you can argue that this is our history. This is our history.\"\n}, 'This is true.', {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: 'So because this is true, this has created a very real fear and rage, a version of PTSD that haunts our African-American brothers and sisters.'\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'acknowledgingInjustice',\n  text: \"And and so I think the only shot we have on progress. Is to develop a deep sense of empathy that is not paternalistic. An acceptance that history has broken some things that systems certainly are broken and an empathy in our hearts towards that so that we might actually mourn with those who mourn. Because I can put it in this arena, maybe it's helpful, it is not uncommon for me to have to go to the hospital because a member of our church has died suddenly and tragically. When I show up and there's the wife or there's the husband or there's the mom and dad sobbing their eyes out, I don't start digging around for the facts before I'm willing to enter into their mourning. OK, listen, I see that you're really broken and really angry. Let me tell you theologically why you shouldn't be. I don't show up and see a morning and see him broken and crying out angry, and I don't enter that space and go, you know, now, where were you when that happened? Guston, you think to do I mean, how wicked of a son of a gun would I be if that's how I handled brokenness? The inability of primarily Anglos to enter the sorrow of our brothers and sisters stems from a lack of proximity, stems from a lack of empathy and a lack of understanding of some of the systemic issues of our nation's history that has brought us to this point. And let me say you the email. I'm white. I like being white. I don't feel guilty for being white. I'm not operating out of white guilt, I'm operating out of a desire to be the people of God in a very dark time, in a very dark time.\"\n}, \"So I don't want you to hear any more from me. I want you to hear from our brothers and sisters, men and a woman that serve you week in and week out, that love you weekend and week out, that are all over our staff structure, from central elder to deaconess to minister to resident that will be sending out. And so will you just join me in welcoming our panel today? It will not be an easy thing for them to share their hearts with us.\", 'One of us.', \"So while they're bringing out chairs, why don't we do this? Thanks, Mike. Why don't we start with anyone? You introduce yourself, say what you do, talk about how long you've been at the village, and then we'll go from there. Yeah.\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"I'm Anthony Moore on the campus, pastor in Fort Worth.

Not that we can correct those feelings or but we just want I want us to understand what it is that happens on a week like this. And and I mean, this is a you'll find out as we begin a conversation. One black person cannot speak for all black people like white people that know he's ever asked me to speak for white people. Right. So there's four different perspectives up here, and there's more than that. Right. But this is a good start. So, Rob, I want to start with you. You know, I've got to talk several times this week. Will you unpack for us a bit a week like this, like what you experience, what you feel, what goes on in your heart and head on a week like this, you know?\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"Yeah, I think my heart is is superheavy. I'm I'm tired. I'm frustrated. I'm angry. I'm mourning. I'm tired of of seeing what appears to be the genocide of my people. I'm mourning. I mean, just the death of these men and many others. And and yeah, I walk around in a in a great deal of fear. I'm just wondering, I mean, Alten for Landow Castiel, like, that could have been me. I mean, I could have been sitting in the passenger seat of my car with my wife and my son in the back seat and and doing everything right. That could have been me. And so so that provokes a great deal of fear in my heart. And so it's a heart weakness. I have a weak my wife walks around in fear wondering, you know, am I going to be like those other wives, you know, am I going to be a single mom? Will I have to will I have to explain certain things to my son that that my white brothers and sisters in Christ may not ever have to start? Yeah.\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"So I want I want to keep kind of digging in with you here. So one of the things in fact, two of the things that we've talked about this week that really were heartbreaking for me. One was that that is loved as you are here and you know, you are men. I mean, I just watch people love you. And and I mean, I've seen you hold more white babies than I think anybody else here, including nursery.\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: 'I was like the Uncle Rob here, you know?'\n}, \"And and yet you shared with me this week that that even is as much as you're very much a part of us, you never really feel quite at home. And that there is there's very much a way that you don't feel safe even with us and sharing certain parts of your heart in certain ways that you're thinking. Can you unpack that a little bit for us? Because I'm kind of for me and I know I speak for a lot of us. That's heartbreaking news because we do love you so much.\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"And thanks that I yeah. I mean, I live in a city where I shop in stores where I am most of the time. The only black dude in a store. I drive on streets where I don't really see a lot of people who look like me also driving on these streets. And so and so I'm uncomfortable. There's a level of discomfort and fear in my heart because I really don't know if this is the day that I get in my car and something could happen to me. And so, yeah, it's hard. And so living in a city where I just don't see a lot of black men and so translate that into the context of the church. The village church is not how I grew up. There's a sound that I love to hear and it's not here. There's a form of preaching, a type of preaching that I grew up listening to and grew up worshiping to. That's it's just not you. And that's nothing against you. I love you. Thank you.\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"But yeah, I could try to, you know, we don't need that, OK?\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"But yeah, just the reality of that is, is that I often come here to the village and I'm uncomfortable, but I, I, I dismiss my my comforts. I dismiss what I want for the sake of the gospel and the explicit truth of God's word.\"\n}, \"But that's more important. But it's uncomfortable and it's difficult. Yeah.\", 'OK, anyone else want to weigh in on the just kind of feelings, thoughts from this past week?', \"Yeah, I think Rob articulated so much of it well, but just to echo the feeling unsafe and then also the anger, I'm thankful for you because this conversation started Wednesday morning. It also was a Thursday afternoon before it became local. But a lot of what I was seeing in social media was when it became a Dallas thing, that's when people started to care. And there was a frustration of why was it not why was there not lament on Wednesday and earlier Thursday? And so I know that people tend to care whether directly affected, but it made it feel like people weren't deeply affected when Altan and Blando had lost their lives.\", \"Yeah, I would say that I echo the anger and the fear and the anxiety, but the emotion that was unique or surprising to me on this round was I felt like I wanted to withdraw a little bit. You know, I feel like in those times when you're navigating how you feel about those tragedies yourself, it wasn't my white brothers and sisters who I have dear friends who are white. It's a good gift from the Lord. But those weren't the people that I innately wanted to run to. And that was kind of new for me. I love people. I love spending time with my people. But there was this need or desire to kind of isolate this week as I process all of that, which I was surprised by, that, you know, I found myself processing a little different.\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"And I think just to reiterate what you said, that not all black people are the same. We're not a Borg, and so we don't all respond the exact same way. I've not had a lot of those feelings, but the place where although I've got the experiences, I can I can point to them. But the place where it really breaks down for me and becomes difficult is trying to explain to my three boys what the history of all of this is. That's just that's just hard to pull them together to say. This is this is what it is. This is why I don't have categories for that. I don't know how to to shepherd them through that. But I think for me, there's just there's a plea and there's kind of a crime, my own heart. And the thing that I want to say to them is, listen, the way forward is to know that that racism is not the unpardonable sin. It's just not and that there's a good likelihood, good potential that they could worship for eternity alongside someone who got the issue of ethnicity or race wrong here on this earth. And just we have that type of scandalous Christianity and grace that's been given to us. And so grace and grace out.\"\n}, 'So thanks, Anthony.', 'Um, so let me ask you, Mike.', \"It's a lot of white folk, and if we could see through the camera, there's even more of them. I think what I find in these situations is like like I never want to take that they're stupid people off the table because that's just reality. But but I think what what persists in and at the village in particular is there's a desire to help, a desire to understand desire. But we can only know what we know. We don't know what to ask. We don't know what's going to be offensive. We don't know how to ask. We you know, there's this kind of feeling of walking on eggshells, but we want to know we want to you know, I remember when we first started having this conversation, I'd get I'd get emails like you keep pushing on this. We're leaving. And I got to early on just go. Well, there's a lot of good churches in the area, so you can go ahead and move your members to go ahead and get it over with. And so now what's left after four years of really having to have this kind of trying to have this conversation, try to move the ball forward is people that really want to understand and want to know, can you coach us a little like what's helpful, what's not helpful, and not just in a season like this, but like a month from now? What's helpful, what's not helpful?\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"I think what's immensely helpful is just the ability to mourn. And sometimes that mourning is being present without saying a lot to feel the weight of to be overwhelmed with in tragic seasons. And then I think in seasons that are not tragic, to be mindful of you, I think we have to think about we care about something, so therefore we'll pray for it. But I think the other way is also true, that if you're continually intentionally praying about something, your care for that thing will grow. So if we care about racial reconciliation, we ought to be praying for it and that ought to be something that's part of us. I think those two things are helpful.\"\n}, {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"I think to things that are unhelpful is initially tragedies are not teaching tools. And so to enter into the conversation in such a way where it's what can I glean from this? How can I learn from this? That's not helpful for Landow Alten. All these officers, officer eher officers Zamarripa, Officer Croll, Officer Thompson, Officer Smith, are real people that lost their lives. They're not illustrations to something. There are families that are altered because of that. And we got to enter in the tragedy in that way. And then I think the other part of it is this. Oftentimes a very well-intentioned people will say, well, I don't see color, I'm color blind, don't strip me of that. That's part of my heart. It's also part of my heritage. Just like your your heritage in your heart is bound up in part of who you are. My blackness is not all that I am, but it's certainly not less than who I am. And so don't let's not strip each other of that. I want to give that to you and the way you see the world. And I also want to be granted that in the way that I see the world is good. It's good.

So where there is relationship, I would encourage you to reach out, where there is not a relationship, it's not the time and tragedy to do so.

You know, if someone were to say to you, you know, when is it appropriate time to abort the fetus, I hope that you would say, I don't want to I don't want to answer the question that you're asking. Like, I I don't want to answer that. And I think the same thing is true with regards to this conversation. There are terms and ways of asking it that don't demonstrate what we believe fundamentally. Who we are in Christ is has been reconciled, reunified. We are one in Christ.\"\n}, 'And so, you know.', {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"I think, Mike, to your point, just to give a little context to morning, when we when we say it's helpful to mourn with us, I mean, it it brings healing to see a white brother or sister cry with me, because what's behind our mourning is more than is more than an altruistic willingness is more than a philanderer. Still, this is more than a Michael Brown is it's more than an Eric Garner is more than a Sandra Bland is. It's more than the indigenous African kings and queens who never made it over here from slave ships. It's it's it's more than than than the history of being lynched as as a people. And so we mourn deeply. And so when we see these things, they remind us of something so much more deeper of a history of this country that continues to point us back to that. And and so and so we mourn rightly. And so enter into that with us and cry with us. That's what that's what's really helpful.\"\n}, \"It's good. Hey, Anthony, I'd love for you to share. We talked a little bit about you know what? The village church is filled with law enforcement officials and officers and Secret Service agents, and you were talking last night about a conversation you had with one of our members who's who's on the Fort Worth Police Department. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how he's seen these things and and kind of what he's carrying in the middle of all this?\", {\n  statementSentiment: 'passTheMic',\n  text: \"Yeah, sure. So I wanted to call him first and foremost, just as a pastor and let him know that I cared and loved him. But I also felt the weight of I want him to know that as a black man, I also care. I feel the weight and there are several and he's a white police officer. We have three or four of them in our and the congregation in Fort Worth. And and so I was reaching out and he in particular, I couldn't get a hold of him. And when he finally responded back, he said, I'm sorry, I've been sleeping. He said, but I'll be honest. He said it's a he's it's a real weird feeling right now. And to love Jesus, love people to be hurting in this situation and yet feel the fear of putting on that uniform. He just said, I'm afraid, and I think what he meant by that was I'm assuming he's saying that he's going to be misunderstood. People are going to try to kill him. People are going to try to hurt him. He's he's worried of all those things. And it just dawned on me because I was getting text from all different people. And so it dawned on me that it's interesting, these groups are saying the exact same thing. This side is saying it not because of a uniform, but because of their appearance, the color of their skin, or saying, I'm afraid I'm worried about being misunderstood. I'm worried about being hurt, all those things. And I'm worried that people are going to think that I'm going to try to hurt them. And so it's just it's an interesting thing to watch both groups say the exact same thing. And so I don't think there's anything lost by and we would if we were actually thinking as missionaries, we would go to a culture, a missionary context or something, and we would look and say there are things to celebrate about that culture and there are things that are dark about it. And we wouldn't have a problem with just kind of acknowledging the difficulty of it and the the goodness of it. And I think it's important to do that right now just to acknowledge some of the difficulty of it and then also celebrate what's good about it on both sides.\"\n}, 'And so. So, yeah.', \"Starting about six years ago, the elders of the village church kind of just put a stake in the ground and said, we're going to commit to, as best we can, becoming a diverse congregation of believers in Christ. And we're going to hire that way. We're going to try to think that we're going to try to learn that way. We're going to try to and and then it's been slow, a lot slower than I would like. But but we've got some traction in the last couple of years. One of the things I'm interested to hear you guys talk about is if if there was a church that was just kind of nailing it and and not like in a moment like this going, OK, let's have this conversation. But just a church that showed with its budget, with its staff, with its preachin, with its singing, with its with its whole heart that what they were after is not to become a black church, but but to become a diverse church where we look more and more and more like Romans seven every year where we tribe, tongue and nation on earth are represented. What would it look like to nail it?

And so I think it matters that we be careful not to group up in just one place, but that we spread out as believers into hard areas and all over the world, and that we're intentional about that. And I think I would say that be careful because you're not the solution. You're going to bring your own complexities and sin. But the gospel that you have is the answer. And so and all the ways that you can hear in Flower Mound there in Fort Worth, all over the place, us being intentional to think of ourselves as elect exiles, we we don't belong here. The Lord is not creating the people to be faithful just for 60, 70, 80, 90 years, but for him for eternity. And he's using your life here to get you ready for that.

And what we feel or what we sense or what we're really wrestling with in here has to be filtered and checked by the truth. And and listen, I. I don't take anything away from that reality. But I think that I have learned over time and pastoral ministry that for anyone to be able to heal, they must be able to express how they feel and have that feeling be met with empathy and compassion, not an exclamation explanation about why they shouldn't feel that way. So I don't know if you're married or not, but next time your wife's upset with you brothers, try to explain to her why she shouldn't use the rational argumentation about why she shouldn't be upset with you because of this and this and this.\"\n}, \"And you're wrong because of these facts.

But but there's a time to be angry and to be afraid and to be confused and to be calloused.\"\n}, \"And then so what I want to do is I want to kind of let's move out of the head and now into the heart and talk about what we're actually feeling and and do some business in that space as opposed to intellectualizing everything. Not that I'm anti intellectual because I'm certainly not. I think these issues are rooted in history that rooted in systems that are rooted in government, the root of the root and all these things. We've got to know those things at some degree to be able to have any shot of moving this thing forward.\", \"And yet to acknowledge today that, hey, man, I'm I'm really angry to acknowledge today.\", \"I mean, I'm afraid those are good things for us to be able to admit and to be able to implement and minister to one another in those spaces, I think as I've watched my own emotions this week, I think I have felt anger like legitimate kind of hot rage, like to fist fight someone anger on multiple occasions this week. And I felt deep sadness this week. And I think in both instances those feelings were justifiable. And so how I thought we would end our time is allowing the Holy Spirit of God to amplify our ability to feel deeply the mess we're in by being really honest about how we actually feel. So one of the ways it's helpful to kind of help that empathy begin to grow in you is to think about just some facts that are true right now.

We've got a shot, we've got a shot, so here, here's what I want, I want to ask you to trust me and if you're a guest here today and you're like, look at this, I've just been here an hour, I don't trust you. I can live with that. Don't trust me at all. But but here's what I want.\", \"If you would be so honest as to just confess. Hey, that in all of this man, I just feel anxious and fearful.

At the village, we're a bit Baptist hostile. All right. And so we're going to gather around these who are saying we're just going to lay a hand on him. And that's not voodoo. That's not magic.

I'm going to ask you, even though you gather around these who are standing and just lay a hand on them, and if all of this is too much for you, then feel free to just stay seated. But if you be so bold, will you lay a hand on these brothers and sisters? And then here's how I would ask you to operate, that you would just pray out loud for these brothers sisters so that your prayers out loud might encourage their hearts. The good thing about our king is he will not get confused at what's being said here. He will hear every utterance and every utterance of the heart.

And so will you soften us, stir up love in our hearts for your beautiful name, I pray. Amen. Thank you.\", \"Why don't you go and have a seat and I want to do one more, because I think on top of hearing this week, fear and anxiety and confusion. I think probably the most consistent emotion I've felt and heard expressed this week is the emotion of anger, of rage, of wanting vengeance, of being just really angry and not really knowing what to do with that. And if you'd be so bold, would you just confess? No, no, it's not fear. Like, I'm I'm friggin furious. I am angry.

I don't know what God has in store.
