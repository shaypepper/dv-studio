He hates sin, and if we identify with it and not with him, we will be judged along with sin, but if we hate sin with him and go, "God, what must we do to be delivered from this body of death?" he says, "Come. Come to the cross where my love was poured out, where my wrath was already poured out. Find forgiveness and reconciliation to me, and be my healing balm of grace. Go and love as you have been loved. Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger."',"The anger of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God, but the anger of God has accomplished salvation for us, poured out in his Son, Jesus Christ. If you know it, would you go preach it? If you have never understood that before, would you come? Would you come and let us tell you about it? There is a little section in the Watermark News. You can just check that. We'll follow up with you this week. You can come right here. Would you go, church? This is your time. Rise up. Bear your cross as you wait for the crown.","Have a great week of worship. We'll see you."],P=["Well, good morning, if you have your Bibles, go ahead and grab those. If you don't have a Bible with you, there should be a hardback black one somewhere around you. If you'll grab that, we're going to be in one verse today. In fact, we're going to get one sentence today, Maika, chapter six, verse eight. And so what I want to do with our time together today is I just kind of want to step into the fray of this past week knowing that there are a lot of landmines there and there are a lot of things that could go wrong by doing this.","And yet I think that the people of God need to enter this dialog with the type of conversation that I hope ultimately will bring healing to souls and and really will allow us to operate as the people of God in the midst of continued tragedy on all sides of this festering wound in the American landscape. It was a tale of two weeks for the pastoral staff here at the village. And and I'll try to explain that. I got back into town on Wednesday morning and really didn't know. I don't take my phone with me or things like that on vacation. So I was completely unaware of the two shootings that had occurred. And so when I got back in and saw the news, I just immediately made a couple of calls to African-American friends of mine to just tell them I was sorry and to just kind of mourn with them. And so really a in between Wednesday at noon and Thursday at 2:00, I had held in my arms and wept with three grown African-American men and then left my office to start my weekend.","My weekend. Thursday night is my Friday night. Friday night is my Saturday Saturday. I'm here with the village church, getting ready to preach to services that night.","And then so I went home Thursday and then of course, we saw what we saw Thursday night. And so all day Friday for us then turned to loving and weeping with law enforcement officials. In fact, we were invited down to Dallas. And so Josh and I went down to Dallas and got to be a part of the the prayer rally there at Thanksgiving Square, praying for the mayor, praying for the chief of police and having a lot of conversations with our law enforcement officials.","And and something that struck me and that Josh and I talked about on the way home is that both the black community and the blue community, they tend to feel very similar things in these situations, although that might not know what he might not like that I say that.","And what I mean by that is my conversations with my African-American friends have involved sadness and rage, a type of despair and my conversations with law enforcement officials. Their their emotions are sadness and rage and a sense of despair and so on. On the way back home, Josh and I were talking about how do we ever get out of this mess? I mean, goodness sakes, it's just been going on forever. When will this ever end? What's the way forward? And so I mentioned the verse that we're about to read and then we begin to talk about the implications of this verse. And here's what I want to do. I'm I'm going to talk for another eight minutes and then I'm going to invite out to join me on the stage four of our African-American brothers and sisters. Three of them are on staff. One is a deaconess here at the village church. And what I want you to do is hear from them and not me today. And so we're going to do a little panel. But I want to set up the panel like this. Micah, Chapter six verse. A lot of theologians would say that the whole of the Old Testament could be summarized in this sentence.","And here is the sentence. He has told you, oh, man, what is good and what does the Lord require of you? But do justice to love, kindness and to walk humbly with your God.\" Now, that sentence looks like a preacher's dream. Done it. I've got three points right there. I mean, how easy is I don't even have to come on. Three points there. There do justice, love, kindness. Walk humbly with God. I'm a poem and a funny illustration away from being done.","And yet that's not what's happening in the text. See what's happening in this text.","Is the explanation that in order to do justice, which is action, you must love kindness and you must walk in humility. And if you cannot walk in humility and you do not love kindness, there will never be any justice, regardless of the color of your skin. And so Josh and I on the way home began to talk about the power of empathy and really the belief that out of the scriptures kind of extrapolating and distilling from the scriptures what the Bible would teach around justice is that progress in the arena, in the arena that we're stuck in this week will only go as far as our empathy will carry us, will only go as far as our empathy will carry us. And so I want to set up our panel like this in order for us to grow in empathy.","It will require humility. You can't be empathetic if you are proud. Right. You just can't do it. Like if you think you're awesome and you've accomplished I mean, you even if your way is right and you can't you don't need to learn anything. You know what you need to know, then you can never be empathetic because you're so dadgum awesome.","I mean, you're just so amazing in your worldview, so amazing and you're so right, how could you ever feel deeply about anybody other than those with your exact same story? It requires humility.","Second thing it requires is presence. You will never develop empathy on Facebook or Twitter.","It requires proximity, it requires proximity, you develop empathy by having deep, legitimate relationships.","And then lastly, empathy and developing empathy requires sacrifice to enter into the pain of others, to enter the sorrow of others, to enter even the rejoicing of others means there's a part of me that dies. And yet I come out more human over time. I come out more human over time. Now, two things I want to set up for our panel. One is some theological truths. And second is some historical facts. And then I'm going to just invite our panel out and let them introduce themselves.","Here's some things we embrace as Christians. So if you're a Christian, you believe this. All right. And so here's we believe in the Imago day that all men and women were created equal in dignity and value and worth by a creator that we are far more valuable as humankind than anything else in all of the creative order so that a man with Down syndrome who cannot take care of himself but needs care is more valuable than Secretariat ever was because he has been made in the image of God. And Secretariat was a horse, a stunningly beautiful, powerful horse, but a horse, not a man.","A man has more value.","Doesn't free up, man, to be cruel, it frees up man to be the image of God. We believe that we believe that sin has infected all of mankind. We believe that their salvation from said we believe as Christians and progressive sanctification. So let's talk about that, because when you start to pull on that, it begins to set up the framework for our discussion today. What we mean when we talk about progressive sanctification, when we quote verses like he who began the good work in me will be faithful to complete it. We're making a confession that we are not yet what we will eventually be. That's what progressive sanctification means. It means that when God sees me, he sees me by the blood of Christ as holy and blameless and spotless in his sight. But my practical experience is that I am not wholly not blameless and not without fault. In fact, if you know me, you know this isn't true. And if you know yourself, you know this isn't true. What makes the gospel so stunning is that as broken, as idolatrous. And it's foolish as I am. God loves me, cherishes me, likes me and sees me as perfect, is not biding his time for me to get more mature before he loves me. And on top of that, he uses me despite my brokenness.","He's not waiting for me to be perfect before he uses me, in fact, oftentimes he'll use my imperfection for his glory.","That's crazy. So let me pull it down to this, then.",{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"Because there are no perfect people and we are all works in progress, that means all systems and structures created by men are intrinsically faulty and broken."},"Because there are no perfect men, there can be no perfect systems, there are systems that are better than others, but but there is no no ship in culture, society, government rule, regulation that does not have cracks in its hull.",{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"They don't exist because there's no such thing as a sinless man outside of Christ. There are men seen by God as holy, spotless, blameless in inside, but we're broken and we build broken things. And if you're a Christian, this is our world view right now. With that said, let me walk through some historical facts. These aren't my opinions. These are historical facts. There has been no ethnic group that has borne the brunt of the brokenness of systems and structures in the United States of America like our African-American brothers and sisters have, we do not have equal historical place in America."},{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"History shows on repeat the betrayal of African-Americans by the very systems and structures that were meant to protect them from the Emancipation Proclamation to 40 acres and a mule that was very quickly taken back from African-Americans and handed back over to former plantation and slave owners, only to institute a new type of slavery on end to Jim Crow, to the Great Migration, into the civil rights. ER, we have nothing in our history but that the systems and structures built to protect and defend have oftentimes bore the dark edge of their blade on African-Americans."},{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"I just don't see how you can argue that this is our history. This is our history."},"This is true.",{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"So because this is true, this has created a very real fear and rage, a version of PTSD that haunts our African-American brothers and sisters."},{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"And and so I think the only shot we have on progress. Is to develop a deep sense of empathy that is not paternalistic. An acceptance that history has broken some things that systems certainly are broken and an empathy in our hearts towards that so that we might actually mourn with those who mourn. Because I can put it in this arena, maybe it's helpful, it is not uncommon for me to have to go to the hospital because a member of our church has died suddenly and tragically. When I show up and there's the wife or there's the husband or there's the mom and dad sobbing their eyes out, I don't start digging around for the facts before I'm willing to enter into their mourning. OK, listen, I see that you're really broken and really angry. Let me tell you theologically why you shouldn't be. I don't show up and see a morning and see him broken and crying out angry, and I don't enter that space and go, you know, now, where were you when that happened? Guston, you think to do I mean, how wicked of a son of a gun would I be if that's how I handled brokenness? The inability of primarily Anglos to enter the sorrow of our brothers and sisters stems from a lack of proximity, stems from a lack of empathy and a lack of understanding of some of the systemic issues of our nation's history that has brought us to this point. And let me say you the email. I'm white. I like being white. I don't feel guilty for being white. I'm not operating out of white guilt, I'm operating out of a desire to be the people of God in a very dark time, in a very dark time."},"So I don't want you to hear any more from me. I want you to hear from our brothers and sisters, men and a woman that serve you week in and week out, that love you weekend and week out, that are all over our staff structure, from central elder to deaconess to minister to resident that will be sending out. And so will you just join me in welcoming our panel today? It will not be an easy thing for them to share their hearts with us.","One of us.","So while they're bringing out chairs, why don't we do this? Thanks, Mike. Why don't we start with anyone? You introduce yourself, say what you do, talk about how long you've been at the village, and then we'll go from there. Yeah.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I'm Anthony Moore on the campus, pastor in Fort Worth. Been here about two years."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Hey, guys, Rob Daniels, connections minister, been on staff almost three years morning, Nikki Lawrence have been at the village for about five years."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I serve in connections with this guy for about three a.m.. And The Decompresses here, Mike Johnny."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I am the pastoral resident at the Dallas campus, and I've been at the village just a little over two years."},"OK, so I want us to just have a real open dialog and and not to worry about how that might be perceived or broken down, because really what I'm after today is for you to help us understand and get a sense of what times like this feel like. Not that we can correct those feelings or but we just want I want us to understand what it is that happens on a week like this. And and I mean, this is a you'll find out as we begin a conversation. One black person cannot speak for all black people like white people that know he's ever asked me to speak for white people. Right. So there's four different perspectives up here, and there's more than that. Right. But this is a good start. So, Rob, I want to start with you. You know, I've got to talk several times this week. Will you unpack for us a bit a week like this, like what you experience, what you feel, what goes on in your heart and head on a week like this, you know?",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Yeah, I think my heart is is superheavy. I'm I'm tired. I'm frustrated. I'm angry. I'm mourning. I'm tired of of seeing what appears to be the genocide of my people. I'm mourning. I mean, just the death of these men and many others. And and yeah, I walk around in a in a great deal of fear. I'm just wondering, I mean, Alten for Landow Castiel, like, that could have been me. I mean, I could have been sitting in the passenger seat of my car with my wife and my son in the back seat and and doing everything right. That could have been me. And so so that provokes a great deal of fear in my heart. And so it's a heart weakness. I have a weak my wife walks around in fear wondering, you know, am I going to be like those other wives, you know, am I going to be a single mom? Will I have to will I have to explain certain things to my son that that my white brothers and sisters in Christ may not ever have to start? Yeah."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"So I want I want to keep kind of digging in with you here. So one of the things in fact, two of the things that we've talked about this week that really were heartbreaking for me. One was that that is loved as you are here and you know, you are men. I mean, I just watch people love you. And and I mean, I've seen you hold more white babies than I think anybody else here, including nursery."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I was like the Uncle Rob here, you know?"},"And and yet you shared with me this week that that even is as much as you're very much a part of us, you never really feel quite at home. And that there is there's very much a way that you don't feel safe even with us and sharing certain parts of your heart in certain ways that you're thinking. Can you unpack that a little bit for us? Because I'm kind of for me and I know I speak for a lot of us. That's heartbreaking news because we do love you so much.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And thanks that I yeah. I mean, I live in a city where I shop in stores where I am most of the time. The only black dude in a store. I drive on streets where I don't really see a lot of people who look like me also driving on these streets. And so and so I'm uncomfortable. There's a level of discomfort and fear in my heart because I really don't know if this is the day that I get in my car and something could happen to me. And so, yeah, it's hard. And so living in a city where I just don't see a lot of black men and so translate that into the context of the church. The village church is not how I grew up. There's a sound that I love to hear and it's not here. There's a form of preaching, a type of preaching that I grew up listening to and grew up worshiping to. That's it's just not you. And that's nothing against you. I love you. Thank you."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"But yeah, I could try to, you know, we don't need that, OK?"},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"But yeah, just the reality of that is, is that I often come here to the village and I'm uncomfortable, but I, I, I dismiss my my comforts. I dismiss what I want for the sake of the gospel and the explicit truth of God's word."},"But that's more important. But it's uncomfortable and it's difficult. Yeah.","OK, anyone else want to weigh in on the just kind of feelings, thoughts from this past week?","Yeah, I think Rob articulated so much of it well, but just to echo the feeling unsafe and then also the anger, I'm thankful for you because this conversation started Wednesday morning. It also was a Thursday afternoon before it became local. But a lot of what I was seeing in social media was when it became a Dallas thing, that's when people started to care. And there was a frustration of why was it not why was there not lament on Wednesday and earlier Thursday? And so I know that people tend to care whether directly affected, but it made it feel like people weren't deeply affected when Altan and Blando had lost their lives.","Yeah, I would say that I echo the anger and the fear and the anxiety, but the emotion that was unique or surprising to me on this round was I felt like I wanted to withdraw a little bit. You know, I feel like in those times when you're navigating how you feel about those tragedies yourself, it wasn't my white brothers and sisters who I have dear friends who are white. It's a good gift from the Lord. But those weren't the people that I innately wanted to run to. And that was kind of new for me. I love people. I love spending time with my people. But there was this need or desire to kind of isolate this week as I process all of that, which I was surprised by, that, you know, I found myself processing a little different.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And I think just to reiterate what you said, that not all black people are the same. We're not a Borg, and so we don't all respond the exact same way. I've not had a lot of those feelings, but the place where although I've got the experiences, I can I can point to them. But the place where it really breaks down for me and becomes difficult is trying to explain to my three boys what the history of all of this is. That's just that's just hard to pull them together to say. This is this is what it is. This is why I don't have categories for that. I don't know how to to shepherd them through that. But I think for me, there's just there's a plea and there's kind of a crime, my own heart. And the thing that I want to say to them is, listen, the way forward is to know that that racism is not the unpardonable sin. It's just not and that there's a good likelihood, good potential that they could worship for eternity alongside someone who got the issue of ethnicity or race wrong here on this earth. And just we have that type of scandalous Christianity and grace that's been given to us. And so grace and grace out."},"So thanks, Anthony.","Um, so let me ask you, Mike.","It's a lot of white folk, and if we could see through the camera, there's even more of them. I think what I find in these situations is like like I never want to take that they're stupid people off the table because that's just reality. But but I think what what persists in and at the village in particular is there's a desire to help, a desire to understand desire. But we can only know what we know. We don't know what to ask. We don't know what's going to be offensive. We don't know how to ask. We you know, there's this kind of feeling of walking on eggshells, but we want to know we want to you know, I remember when we first started having this conversation, I'd get I'd get emails like you keep pushing on this. We're leaving. And I got to early on just go. Well, there's a lot of good churches in the area, so you can go ahead and move your members to go ahead and get it over with. And so now what's left after four years of really having to have this kind of trying to have this conversation, try to move the ball forward is people that really want to understand and want to know, can you coach us a little like what's helpful, what's not helpful, and not just in a season like this, but like a month from now? What's helpful, what's not helpful?",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I think what's immensely helpful is just the ability to mourn. And sometimes that mourning is being present without saying a lot to feel the weight of to be overwhelmed with in tragic seasons. And then I think in seasons that are not tragic, to be mindful of you, I think we have to think about we care about something, so therefore we'll pray for it. But I think the other way is also true, that if you're continually intentionally praying about something, your care for that thing will grow. So if we care about racial reconciliation, we ought to be praying for it and that ought to be something that's part of us. I think those two things are helpful."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I think to things that are unhelpful is initially tragedies are not teaching tools. And so to enter into the conversation in such a way where it's what can I glean from this? How can I learn from this? That's not helpful for Landow Alten. All these officers, officer eher officers Zamarripa, Officer Croll, Officer Thompson, Officer Smith, are real people that lost their lives. They're not illustrations to something. There are families that are altered because of that. And we got to enter in the tragedy in that way. And then I think the other part of it is this. Oftentimes a very well-intentioned people will say, well, I don't see color, I'm color blind, don't strip me of that. That's part of my heart. It's also part of my heritage. Just like your your heritage in your heart is bound up in part of who you are. My blackness is not all that I am, but it's certainly not less than who I am. And so don't let's not strip each other of that. I want to give that to you and the way you see the world. And I also want to be granted that in the way that I see the world is good. It's good. Thank you."},"Yeah. Thank you.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Anyone else on that, I would just say from a practical perspective, I would encourage you to say something where there is a relationship and I had some sweet friend texted me this week and just say, I don't know what to say, but I don't want to not say anything. And even that was such a bomb to like a fresh wound reopening. So where there is relationship, I would encourage you to reach out, where there is not a relationship, it's not the time and tragedy to do so. But that is very helpful."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Silence, I would say, is not helpful at times like this. OK."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Anthony, I can't help but I mean, as a pastor, wanting and desiring that Fort Worth and and all of the village church and all believers have this conversation in a way that's different than the world, we not accept the categories and the definitions and the way that they ask questions. You know, if someone were to say to you, you know, when is it appropriate time to abort the fetus, I hope that you would say, I don't want to I don't want to answer the question that you're asking. Like, I I don't want to answer that. And I think the same thing is true with regards to this conversation. There are terms and ways of asking it that don't demonstrate what we believe fundamentally. Who we are in Christ is has been reconciled, reunified. We are one in Christ."},"And so, you know.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I think, Mike, to your point, just to give a little context to morning, when we when we say it's helpful to mourn with us, I mean, it it brings healing to see a white brother or sister cry with me, because what's behind our mourning is more than is more than an altruistic willingness is more than a philanderer. Still, this is more than a Michael Brown is it's more than an Eric Garner is more than a Sandra Bland is. It's more than the indigenous African kings and queens who never made it over here from slave ships. It's it's it's more than than than the history of being lynched as as a people. And so we mourn deeply. And so when we see these things, they remind us of something so much more deeper of a history of this country that continues to point us back to that. And and so and so we mourn rightly. And so enter into that with us and cry with us. That's what that's what's really helpful."},"It's good. Hey, Anthony, I'd love for you to share. We talked a little bit about you know what? The village church is filled with law enforcement officials and officers and Secret Service agents, and you were talking last night about a conversation you had with one of our members who's who's on the Fort Worth Police Department. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how he's seen these things and and kind of what he's carrying in the middle of all this?",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Yeah, sure. So I wanted to call him first and foremost, just as a pastor and let him know that I cared and loved him. But I also felt the weight of I want him to know that as a black man, I also care. I feel the weight and there are several and he's a white police officer. We have three or four of them in our and the congregation in Fort Worth. And and so I was reaching out and he in particular, I couldn't get a hold of him. And when he finally responded back, he said, I'm sorry, I've been sleeping. He said, but I'll be honest. He said it's a he's it's a real weird feeling right now. And to love Jesus, love people to be hurting in this situation and yet feel the fear of putting on that uniform. He just said, I'm afraid, and I think what he meant by that was I'm assuming he's saying that he's going to be misunderstood. People are going to try to kill him. People are going to try to hurt him. He's he's worried of all those things. And it just dawned on me because I was getting text from all different people. And so it dawned on me that it's interesting, these groups are saying the exact same thing. This side is saying it not because of a uniform, but because of their appearance, the color of their skin, or saying, I'm afraid I'm worried about being misunderstood. I'm worried about being hurt, all those things. And I'm worried that people are going to think that I'm going to try to hurt them. And so it's just it's an interesting thing to watch both groups say the exact same thing. And so I don't think there's anything lost by and we would if we were actually thinking as missionaries, we would go to a culture, a missionary context or something, and we would look and say there are things to celebrate about that culture and there are things that are dark about it. And we wouldn't have a problem with just kind of acknowledging the difficulty of it and the the goodness of it. And I think it's important to do that right now just to acknowledge some of the difficulty of it and then also celebrate what's good about it on both sides."},"And so. So, yeah.","Starting about six years ago, the elders of the village church kind of just put a stake in the ground and said, we're going to commit to, as best we can, becoming a diverse congregation of believers in Christ. And we're going to hire that way. We're going to try to think that we're going to try to learn that way. We're going to try to and and then it's been slow, a lot slower than I would like. But but we've got some traction in the last couple of years. One of the things I'm interested to hear you guys talk about is if if there was a church that was just kind of nailing it and and not like in a moment like this going, OK, let's have this conversation. But just a church that showed with its budget, with its staff, with its preachin, with its singing, with its with its whole heart that what they were after is not to become a black church, but but to become a diverse church where we look more and more and more like Romans seven every year where we tribe, tongue and nation on earth are represented. What would it look like to nail it? Keep in mind the audience that that we're talking to, like what does it look like to nail being serious about being a multiethnic church?",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Welcome. Welcome to my world."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I've been talking a lot, so I'll be quicker. The pastor in me wants to preach. You know, I think that, you know, I think proximity matters."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And, you know, you think about the Lord inhabits the glory of of God himself and is the right hand of the father. And if he comes down and he tabernacles among us, he lives among us proximity matters. And so I think it matters that we be careful not to group up in just one place, but that we spread out as believers into hard areas and all over the world, and that we're intentional about that. And I think I would say that be careful because you're not the solution. You're going to bring your own complexities and sin. But the gospel that you have is the answer. And so and all the ways that you can hear in Flower Mound there in Fort Worth, all over the place, us being intentional to think of ourselves as elect exiles, we we don't belong here. The Lord is not creating the people to be faithful just for 60, 70, 80, 90 years, but for him for eternity. And he's using your life here to get you ready for that. So live on mission."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And I would add to that where proximity is not possible, partnership always is. And so I think a church that's nailing it is praying for supporting church plans and church planters that are in hard context, that are different than theirs, that are saying, I'm praying for you. I'm sending you resources not to make you us, but to let you be you as effectively as you can be."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"So I think even being mindful, learning the names of inner city church plans or different context, church plans that you can be praying for and partnering with is a big way the church can nail it."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Man, if I could add, I think we're always talking about it as a church. I think it's a fluid conversation all year, regardless of what's happening in our society. I think that's reflected in blogs, strategically, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc., that we're continuing to just address kind of the history between the two groups and and push forward racial reconciliation."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"Yeah. So I love the missional aspect. And I think if we kill it, if we're nailing it, we're about mission. We're ferocious and unapologetic about the gospel and we don't mind being uncomfortable. And so and so this conversation can't just end with just us talking about it. But I think we also, if we're going to be serious about it, be about entering into uncomfortable spaces. And for some of us, that may mean moving, moving. And for some of us, that also may mean partnering. But if we're killing it, we're ferocious and serious about the gospel, not just talking that we're believers and Christians, but that we're actively sharing our faith wherever we go in hopes that some may come to know Christ who don't look like us. That's good."},"So I haven't at this will be the only service I asked this question. What what am I not asking that I should be asking?",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I think the question would be, what's next? Yeah, you hear this panel, you hear us, you see us. We all sit in a manner of grief or frustration or anger. I think the lingering question for all of us is what next? What what do we do after this? Has this just been another great panel or have you just heard more stories? But I think the question is really what's next? OK, what's next, guys?"},"Lunch a lot. Well, lunch is for sure. Lunch with each other.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"OK, I, I think is worth us sitting down and really counting the cost to I mean, it's a loss right now that we as the church, we don't have a platform to stand on and say right now to the to our country, look at us. We've got to figure it out, but I think that's what in the scriptures, ethnicities gathered together, united together, and people are trying to figure out what in the world unites these people. But the blood of Christ is what we're supposed to have. So it's a loss right now that we don't have that. It's not that diversity is the most important thing. It's that it witnesses to the truth and beauty and goodness of Christ. And so not to have it is a loss. So I think we got to ask the question, what's it going to cost us? He's going to write something that what is it going to cost us to do this?

Let's get the gospel."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"I think at an individual level, we get serious about diversifying our friendship groups. I love Matt, how at the top of every year you kind of encourage us to look at our friend landscape. And so does everyone look like you or do you come from the same background? I think there's rich fruit in sharing stories, you know, all throughout the year and building relationships with people that are not like you. I know here at the Village Flower Mound, we have people gathering women. At least I know I'm in one where we're completely different, eight of us. But we're coming to the table and saying, I want to know you. I want to know your people, know your history. So I would encourage everyone in here to kind of look at their landscape and go, where can I grow in this area? Who can I begin to engage with? That's nothing like me. So that when tragedy happens, you're pressing in with someone you have relationship with."},{statementSentiment:"importanceOfDiversity",text:"OK, so let me press I, I think last time we really kind of looked at it. You're looking at twelve thousand thirteen, fourteen thousand people at the village church, maybe 300 of them, 400 of them African-Americans, which like that's such a big move forward from ten years ago that I'm super encouraged by it and yet super depressed by it simultaneously. So I feel like when I have that conversation every year, like the push I get from both African-Americans and whites as whites are like, where are they? And African-Americans are like 32 people just invited me to lunch."},"So and I'm a true story. Yeah, it's a true story. Right. So, like, I can see what I'm saying. I'm African-American brothers is like, oh, my gosh, here it is. Just a tidal wave of white invitations are about to come over. So. So how do we position in proximity? Because that's my question. And there's something going on here I'm trying to pull out.","And and and so I think what I'm trying to pull out is that now that the shops have been built here and everything's here, like we just don't need to leave much anymore. And when you don't leave, you don't know that two exits down from us.",{statementSentiment:"acknowledgingInjustice",text:"They don't look much like us at all, and their life experience hasn't been what our life experience has been and and the proximity piece is what I'm really trying to kind of dig into that. If we've got any real shot at empathy that is a game changer, then some of us do need to move and some of us do need to change where we work out, where we get our haircut and where we and those are the kind of things I'm trying to pull on because there's just not it's not we're so far away from even being close to being able to get in proximity with one another. I mean, it's going to be one African-American for every, you know, 22 white people. It's going to be extremely difficult. But we've got this community just south of us. And it's back to your mission point that we just haven't figured out how to engage and and aren't willing to engage, it seems, other than to maybe write a check, which I think fine, but to our shame to not want to get your hands dirty."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And so and I would say and you've said this often here lately, that we are not primarily thinking people, but we're primarily feeling people. So proximity is not just physical, but it's emotional. It is the let me read things that are stirring the hearts of my African-American brothers or at the Dallas campus of our Hispanic brothers and sisters. How do I understand their world? How do I enter in and think the way about the way things that they are thinking? How do I begin to immerse myself in what's true for them, that I have an experience? I think it's physical primarily, yes. But also a deep emotional bonding to others. Yeah."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And there's such a danger in Christianity becoming preaching points.

Just this world stinks. This is not supposed to be our home. Feel the weight of eternity. Feel the weight of the glory of God. And you have that. We're demonstrating that and so live on mission to get that out. And so now these these and I just want to open up the conversation even bigger at that point, say not just thinking about, you know, African-American blacks, things like that, but just in general, Christian, think of yourself that way. Don't set up shop here. Just make your way through quickly. Live for the glory of God and for eternity alone. That's it."},"So that's good.

Thank you."},"All right, guys, thank you.",{statementSentiment:"encouragingEmpathy",text:"So one of the things I wanted to address and as I kind of turn our attention more to responding to what we've heard today is the stream in which we reside in evangelicalism. And because we're children of modernity, we've been taught that the life of the mind is primary. And what we feel or what we sense or what we're really wrestling with in here has to be filtered and checked by the truth. And and listen, I. I don't take anything away from that reality. But I think that I have learned over time and pastoral ministry that for anyone to be able to heal, they must be able to express how they feel and have that feeling be met with empathy and compassion, not an exclamation explanation about why they shouldn't feel that way. So I don't know if you're married or not, but next time your wife's upset with you brothers, try to explain to her why she shouldn't use the rational argumentation about why she shouldn't be upset with you because of this and this and this."},"And you're wrong because of these facts. Doesn't go well. Yeah, it doesn't. It's just not. And it just never because you should respond feeling to feel, in fact, to fact.",{statementSentiment:"invalidating",text:"And when someone shares a feeling with you and you confront that with fact, what you're saying to the person that stops them from being able to heal is that what you're feeling doesn't matter. And that can never be true. Now, what we're feeling might be misinformed, and that's where the truth gets laid on top of that. But but there's a time to be angry and to be afraid and to be confused and to be calloused."},"And then so what I want to do is I want to kind of let's move out of the head and now into the heart and talk about what we're actually feeling and and do some business in that space as opposed to intellectualizing everything. Not that I'm anti intellectual because I'm certainly not. I think these issues are rooted in history that rooted in systems that are rooted in government, the root of the root and all these things. We've got to know those things at some degree to be able to have any shot of moving this thing forward.","And yet to acknowledge today that, hey, man, I'm I'm really angry to acknowledge today.","I mean, I'm afraid those are good things for us to be able to admit and to be able to implement and minister to one another in those spaces, I think as I've watched my own emotions this week, I think I have felt anger like legitimate kind of hot rage, like to fist fight someone anger on multiple occasions this week. And I felt deep sadness this week. And I think in both instances those feelings were justifiable. And so how I thought we would end our time is allowing the Holy Spirit of God to amplify our ability to feel deeply the mess we're in by being really honest about how we actually feel. So one of the ways it's helpful to kind of help that empathy begin to grow in you is to think about just some facts that are true right now. And here's some facts that are true right now.","There are five police officers, five police officers, families who are in church this morning. Many of them had young children. One of them had just been married two weeks ago. And the carnage that has been left behind there is heartbreaking five men who made less than 50 grand a year, who chose to, according to Romans, 50, restrain evil for the good of society are dead.","They're gone. They've left morning children. They left mourning spouses. They've left mourning friends. They're dead. And there's a four year old little girl out there who watched her daddy bleed out and gasp for air.","Before his life left him, right now, she exist, a four year old little girl trying to process that. Right now there's a 15 year old boy.","Who's heartbroken and doesn't understand what just happened to his daddy, that he's seen a video of his dad being slammed to the ground, pinned to the ground, and then shot multiple times. These are real people that exist. And when you and I shift gears into wanting to know all the facts that would have happened if instead of just lamenting it shows that there's something broken in us, it shows something's gone awry in us. Christian Smith, who I love, he's a sociologist, professor at Notre Dame. He said one of the greatest divides in America is between the way black evangelicals and white evangelicals see the world, that the chasm is not so much even in our society as much as it's in our church.","And for Anthony's point, where where the church can demonstrate empathy, understanding and togetherness here. We've got a shot, we've got a shot, so here, here's what I want, I want to ask you to trust me and if you're a guest here today and you're like, look at this, I've just been here an hour, I don't trust you. I can live with that. Don't trust me at all. But but here's what I want.","If you would be so honest as to just confess. Hey, that in all of this man, I just feel anxious and fearful. If that's you, would you just raise your hand? I just feel anxious and fearful. I'm a bit confused. Frayed.","OK, now here's where I need you to trust me. Would you just stand up if you raise your hands? I'm anxious. Where would you stand up where you are? You don't need to feel embarrassed by that or you just stand up where you are now. Now, here's what I want to do.","If you're sitting down and that's not an emotion you're feeling, you don't feel afraid or anxious, you're feeling something else. I'm going to do one other one after this. What I want to do is in our position of privilege. I want to pray over these brothers and sisters, the peace of God, the peace that passes, all understanding that fear would be driven out and that love would replace it. And so here's how we do that. At the village, we're a bit Baptist hostile. All right. And so we're going to gather around these who are saying we're just going to lay a hand on him. And that's not voodoo. That's not magic. That's us saying we're with you and we're going to pray out loud that God would establish peace in their hearts. I'm going to ask you, even though you gather around these who are standing and just lay a hand on them, and if all of this is too much for you, then feel free to just stay seated. But if you be so bold, will you lay a hand on these brothers and sisters? And then here's how I would ask you to operate, that you would just pray out loud for these brothers sisters so that your prayers out loud might encourage their hearts. The good thing about our king is he will not get confused at what's being said here. He will hear every utterance and every utterance of the heart. He will hear what we should pray and don't know how to. But we begin to pray out loud for these brothers and sisters. You take it from here. You pray for him for just a moment or two. Father, you know, it's scary to be us.","You are sovereign, you know, all things we are limited in scope, limited and understanding.","Your sovereign plan in in your divine essence.","Makes sense.","And is beautiful and good and right, but to us here.","It feels broken and scary.","And to the spouses of our law enforcement officers, it feels terrifying.","And to our African-American mommies and daddies, it feels terrifying.","So we pray, spirit of God, that you'd bring peace to our hearts. I need you to bring rest to our hearts that love would drive out fear. We ask you to do this because this is not some sort of intellectual game, the mind feeds the heart, but but the heart must be softened to hear what is true. And so will you soften us, stir up love in our hearts for your beautiful name, I pray. Amen. Thank you.","Why don't you go and have a seat and I want to do one more, because I think on top of hearing this week, fear and anxiety and confusion. I think probably the most consistent emotion I've felt and heard expressed this week is the emotion of anger, of rage, of wanting vengeance, of being just really angry and not really knowing what to do with that. And if you'd be so bold, would you just confess? No, no, it's not fear. Like, I'm I'm friggin furious. I am angry. I feel boiling in my blood.","So let me say this about anger real quick, and then we'll see if more of you will be honest.","The problem with Christians and anger is somewhere along the way, Christians have forgotten that the Lord actually commands us to be angry. We have taken Jesus in our day and age and made him kind of Tinkerbelle with a little pouch of fairy dust, who never gets upset, who's not the same Jesus that flipped over tables and drove people out of the temple, who isn't the Jesus that rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees for how they oppressed and put heavy chains on people. And so when you make Jesus Tinkerbelle, you don't have category for Christian rage. But Paul clearly tells us, in fact, it is a command in Ephesians four.","Be angry. But don't sin now. Now, why why are we to be angry and not say because vengeance belongs to the Lord? Because what the Lord has in store for evil doers is far greater than anything I'd be able to do with my pettily human hands, and maybe you're all swept up and thing on my hands. I don't know what God has in store. For those who oppress and for those who happily participate in injustice.","Is a far worse wrath than anything human hands could divvy out, so we trust that justice belongs to the Lord. It doesn't mean we don't act, it doesn't mean we don't move. It means we are freed from needing to exact vengeance because our God will. He is gracious. He is a healer. He is merciful, and he will slaughter.",{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"The oppressor."},{statementSentiment:"passTheMic",text:"And he will destroy and disembowel, according to the scriptures, those who happily participate in injustice. So we get to be angry because it's right to be angry. And trust that God will extend grace and forgiveness and heal, leading to repentance, or he will justly and right judge and in that space we get to sleep."},"So if the emotion that's just kind of been driving in your heart and in your head, the one you've been trying to wrestle and fight with is anger or rage, I want you to just stand up for me now. We want to pray for you and pray kind of the same thing. Pray the peace of God over your life, a confidence and in God's righteous indignation against those who would oppress and unjustly harm.","So we're going to do the same thing now let's gather around these brothers and sisters of ours and lay a hand on him again. Maybe this is your first time here. Maybe you don't want anybody's hand on you. You are completely free to go. All right. I hear what he's saying. Don't put your hand on me and we won't put our hands on your right. This is just what we do in time. You'll let us. But this is a first date stuff, right? It's not time later.","And so we want to pray for these brothers and sisters the same thing, that God would establish peace in their hearts, that he would heal that rage, that they could feel a release in trusting that God.","Has vengeance in his right hand. Let's pray for these brothers and sisters of ours who are standing again. Let them hear your voice, pray for them out loud, let their healing come from the spirit of God through the prayers of his saints. Let's pray together.","Spirit of God, we just confess as the people of God, that we are angry. At the state of affairs this past week, we are angry at the death of these seven men, it seems like madness to us.","And so we just want to cry out to you in just a raw honesty that that man, we we know you're at work in this mess, and yet we feel a sense of anger and rage, even just anger and rage, not even sinful anger and rage, but justifiable rage.","So we ask you, Holy Spirit of God. Increase our confidence in your sovereign rain guard.","Allow peace to wash over us, let empathy and pity replace rage.","But we feel deeply the loss of our African-American brothers and sisters, that we feel deeply the loss and the fear among our law enforcement officials and and might we say that the see that the black and the blue have been pitted against one another and in a type of broken system that really sees both of them, both of them impede.","Of the dignity, do their humanity.","And so we just ask Holy Spirit of God do work in us as individuals, in us as a church for a time such as this.","We need you, Jesus, we need you.","Not just for individual salvation, although we praise you for that, but make us your people. Thank you for these four brothers and my sister and so many more who have stepped into this place as a type of missionary where music is and exactly what they would like and and preaching is maybe a little bit different. And yet they're here because they believe your truth, your word, bless them.","Help us through your beautiful name, I pray, amen.","By and large, the way, and again I think I've already said this but I'll say it again. I'm white. I don't feel guilty for being white. I've never really wrestled with \"I wish I wasn't a white guy\". It just hasn't happend.","But I will say this. That I have been taught my entire life that racism is wicked acts carried out by wicked people. That's what racism is.","So in my education and in my growth as a human being, the idea that there could be systems and institutions that are skewed in my direction--because I did not grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth. We grew up poor. Had a home repossessed, a car repossessed. We came out of next to nothing.","but, when I learned about forty acres and a mule, it was about five minutes of an hour long class. When I learned about the civil rights era and what was going on in that, it was thirty minutes, forty-five minutes of an hour lonng class. I knew nothing of the great migration. I knew nothing of Jim Crow law. I knew nothing of these realities that have so shaped and tilted the instiutions in my favor.","So that racism is not just wicked acts perpetrated by wicked men, but rather the silence  of those who enjoy privilege being unable to empathize with those who have not recieved such privilege. And I certainly know that I have emails coming for me this week. And yet, I'm just fully convincedby the word of god  and that in history that what  I'm saying is true and that there will be no real healng until we're willing to lean into this.","Whites-- you don't need to feel guilty about  slavery or feel guilty about Jim Crow. You don't need to feel guilty for these things. That's not what we're trying to do. What you need to feel is honest empathy and not in a way that's paternalistic.","Just that we might weep. We might long for healing. This festering wound might finally by the spirit of Christ be driven out of our interactions and understandings of one another.","So we need to pray. We need to act. We need to continue to have this conversation. And so my hope is that in the months--weeks--years to come that more and more and more we'll see what Jesus can do here."],Y=["A man, well, this is what it's all about, this is why we gather together as a church to be together under the lordship of Christ, calling out for his presence, receiving comfort and hope, and hopefully today a challenge from his word. I invite you to grab your Bibles and turn to Hosea. Chapter six, the Old Testament Book of Hosea. I need to confess to you today that with all this going on this week, I have really struggled with what to preach on this weekend. I had a message planned and was in the middle of writing it as the events on Thursday evening began to unfold. And I certainly don't want to sound super spiritual or sensational in any way. But after talking with Pastor Graham, he confirmed what God was speaking in my own heart, and that is that we need to address head on from a biblical standpoint what we see going on across our nation in these days. And so I really have been praying and seeking the Lord and I trust sensitive to his spirits leading regarding this message today.","I woke up yesterday morning and as I do every single morning, go first to get my cup of coffee and then to an area in the house where I can read the news and read my Bible.","And we had ship the kids off to their grandparents. And so it was gloriously quiet. Thank the Lord for grandparents. And I turned on the news and began to read it. And one of the major outlets, CNN, I want to show you the image here on the screen, had the headline. And in big, bold letters were these words, Who can heal America? And I read the article, I looked at the headline and I thought, this is the title of the message today. And it is the question that I hope to answer in our time together this morning. Who Can Heal America? The article begins by detailing what happened this last week. And the shooting of two African women out in Sterling in Louisiana is still in Minnesota. It then goes on to outline what happened here in our own backyard, the city in which we love. We saw the worst loss of life in public and police life since nine one one.","The article then goes on to quote House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said this. It's been a long week for our country. It's been a long month for America. We've seen terrible, terrible, senseless things, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday, describing the latest scenes of horror and loss. The article continues and it says political leaders, many like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, with crucial elections on their minds, are getting used to tearing up their schedules in the wake of tragedies that shocked the nation.","Yet despite all of the calls for unity, the prayers offered and the platitudes voice, there are few signs yet that any candidate, lawmaker, law enforcement leader or civil rights campaigner has mustered the trust and respect of voters needed to knit a mournful nation together and fresh in the stale national debate on race and violence. Thus, the question is asked who can heal America? And it's a good question.","The world today is asking and looking. And saying to everyone, is there someone out there that can bring hope? Is there someone out there that can bring healing to our country, that can stop all of this violence that we're seeing as a church?",{statementSentiment:"theAnswerIsJesus",text:"We must be ready and willing to provide for them and answer. And as Christians, we know what the answer is, right? I mean, the answer is Jesus. He is the only hope and the answer is revival. We need a fresh wind of the spirit of God to move through our country unlike ever before."},"I sent a tweet out on Thursday evening as I was watching the news and just expressing how broken hearted I was over the brokenness of the world around us.","And I said in that tweet, Only Jesus can fix this. And I quickly followed it up, saying, this is not a trite saying, this is the truth.","Only Jesus can fix this. And so we need him more than ever. We need revival.","And I believe that we have hope today because revival has happened in our country before, I have in a very small book in my library a book by the name of America's great revivals, and it outlines a series of revivals that swept through our country from the year seventeen thirty four to eighteen ninety nine. And of course refers to the second great first and second Great Awakenings. And under the preaching of men like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield and John Wesley and just a two year span, we're told, stories of three hundred thousand people committing their lives to Christ and renewing their hearts to him just in two years.","It was unlike anything this nation and its young history had ever seen before. The first Great Awakening. And then fast forward one hundred years later, there was a man by the name of Jeremiah Lanphier. He was a layman and he began to be very burdened for the country that he loved. He saw it declining spiritually, and he he wanted a fresh wind of the spirit of God. He wanted God to to come again and return to the country that he loved to bring revival. And so he began knocking on doors. And for three months, he went door to door, home to home, business to business.","And he been in, again, inviting people into a prayer meeting and they decided they would have the first one on a Wednesday at 12:30. And so they reserved a little room in their church. And after three months of inviting people to come, six people showed up to pray that day begging God to move.","They weren't discouraged at the end of that meeting, rather, their prayers encouraged them in their spirits and they said, let's meet again next week. We'll keep getting the word out. And if anybody shows up, this is of God. More people will come. The very next Wednesday, 20 people showed up praying for revival. Fast forward a few months down the road.","Three thousand people.","Showed up to pray. They had to move it out of that little building and even out of that little church and they were meeting and businesses and homes all over New York City.","Six months later, ten thousand people were gathering all over New York City to pray for a mighty move of God, what happened in New York and made his way to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Boston and Boston to Chicago and under the preaching of men like Charles Finney and D.L. Moody, we saw this second great awakening where thousands upon thousands.","Gave their life to Christ and revival swept through our country. And most people point back to that one prayer gathering starting in the heart of one lay person, the authors noted this book says revival has been. And it still is the product of repentance and prayer and dedication.","We are reminded that nationwide spiritual upheavals have begun when God's children minister and laymen have fallen to their knees and sought power from on high. The God of Edwards and Lanphier and Phinney and Moody is our God today. And to that I say Amen.","Hebrews 13 eight. The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. And so when we read the stories of revival, when we hear about the stories of God moving in a powerful way, we see this is what our troubled nation needs. And if he's done it once, I want to cry out with my voice.","Lord, do it again, Lord, do it again. We are in desperate need for a mighty move of your spirit.","And so the question.","But I've been wrestling with in these past few weeks, really? Is as individuals, as a church. Is there a position that we can take?","Is there an attitude that we can foster?","Is there a petition that we need to make, is there something that we can do to bring about this third great awakening and usher in the presence of God to bring about revival that we so desperately need and desire and to bring healing to this country? Is there something we can do? And I believe there is find the answer and the solution to our problem in Hosea, Chapter six.","Starting in verse one, the Bible says this.","Come, let us return to the Lord. It's an invitation. Come, let us together, return to the Lord. If you're looking for a practical takeaway, if you're looking for application, today's message, it's that one word, the word return. It's a powerful word. In fact, I want us to say it together. Return. It's mentioned over a thousand times in the Old Testament, twenty three times in the Book of Hosea alone.","It is a major theme in this Old Testament.","But come, let us return to the Lord. For he has torn us that he may heal us.","He has struck us down and he will bind us up after two days, he will revive us and on the third day he will raise us up that we may live before him. Let us know.","Let us press on to know the Lord. His going out is assures the dawn he will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth. Now, I have to tell you, I love the Book of Hosea, a 14 chapters long, you can read it in one sitting. It is rich in historical content, poetic in form, written in the 8th century.","Its message is one that highlights the faithfulness and love of God, Israel at this point in its nation's history. It is is at an historic low mark. The people are depraved. They're living in sin.","They've drifted so far away from God. They don't even know how far they have fallen. In fact, the parallels between Israel then and America now are striking.","Just listen to some of the sins that characterize the nation of Israel and see if any of it sounds familiar. Number one, there is swearing and falsehood.","The Bible says at this time, in nations of Israel's history, there is murder and bloodshed. Adultery and perversion is prevalent, it's everywhere.","Gross idolatry of all kinds, Israel was making foreign alliances with nations that had no business making foreign alliances with. The people are said to be full of deception and drunkenness.","There was a failure to heed God's continual warnings, they're called an ungrateful people, and they were no longer giving God glory for anything. And here's an interesting fact.","As part of God's divine judgment upon them, he begins to send evil kings to rule over them.","Sum it all up, there are no longer being faithful to God. They're no longer living under his rule and for his purposes, and this is where we pick up with.","He was a prophet raised up by God and like all of the Old Testament prophets, he had a message, a verbal message to communicate to the people of God that God so dearly loved.","They were his treasured possession. But unlike some of the other prophets, Hosea wasn't just to preach a message, he was to leave a message out in front of him.","And it was a bold, explicit message. I wish we had time to unpack the tire story, but for the sake of time, I want to share with you three major sins that the nation of Israel was guilty of and that God points out and calls out in this people that he loved so very much. We make our way to Hosie, a chapter for.","And Hosea, chapter four, verse one.","The Bible says this here, the word of the Lord. Children of Israel for the Lord has a controversy. Some of your Bibles say the Lord has a charge. It's a legal term. It's a judicial term. It means a rebuke, a quarrel. It's as if God rolling up his sleeves goes, I've got to fight to pick. And this is what it's over.","He says there's no faithfulness. Or steadfast love. And no knowledge of God in the land. Three major sins that God calls out, he says there's no faithfulness. There's no integrity, there's no fidelity, and as a result, the very foundations of the nation of Israel is crumbling. There's an apathy towards God, there's a complacency toward God, absolutely no faithfulness. He says there's no steadfast love, no loyalty toward God. One of the strongest words we have in the Hebrew language right here, no steadfast love, no loyalty, neither towards God nor towards one another. So there's no compassion, there's no going the extra mile, everyone's looking out for self, no steadfast love.","And he says there's no knowledge of God in this case with the two ideas, one is a personal relationship. Israel had entered into a covenant with God. There was supposed to be a personal relationship there. He was their God and they were his people.","But through the years and the spiritual decline of the country, they have forsaken this personal relationship with God and the other idea is there was no knowledge of God in the first place because as we'll see in a moment, God's law wasn't being taught anymore. So how could there be a knowledge of God? Now you think about where we are as a country. No faithfulness, no steadfast love toward God or one another, no knowledge of God in the land, and when these three sins are present, what is the result? It'll be the same result for us as it was for the nation of Israel. Look at verse two and three. There is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, committing adultery. They break all bounds where these things are present. You're going to have people pushing the limits, crossing all of the boundaries, doing things you could never conceive someone to do. And bloodshed follows bloodshed. Therefore, the land mourns and all who dwell in it languish. And also the beast of the field and the birds of the heaven and even the fish of the sea are taken away. And so look at what is taking place here. He's saying sin affects everything.","It affects your relationship with God, it affects your relationship with others.","In this text, we see it even affects your land. It's the devastating consequences of sin. Of going our own way instead of going God's way.","Now, what I want to do is, for a brief moment, take a step back and.","Ask this question, how on earth did Israel get here again? It wasn't always this way. His treasured possession, he led them by a promise out of slavery and into the promised land, a land of blessing. How did they get here?","Where can you point?","What happened, who is to blame? The text answers that for us, and I think the answer will surprise you look at versus four and five. Yeah, let no one Conten let no one accuse. He says don't point the finger over at this group and say it's your fault over here that you've gone so far away.","Israel, don't point it over here at this group and say it's because of you over here in the decisions that you've made that the nation has gone so far down the road. He says don't they don't contend with one another. Let me tell you who to point the finger to.","He says, my contention is with you Opry's, you shall stumble by day and the prophet shall stumble with you by night, and therefore I will destroy your mother. God places the blame for Israel's demise as a nation first and foremost, squarely on the backs of the spiritual leadership of that day. Says you want to know whose fault it is. It's the prophets. It's the priests. It's the pastors. Put it on them.","I got to tell you, that was not the answer I was looking for in my study this week.","But it's true.","It demonstrates a principle that we see throughout scripture. And that is as the leader goes, so goes the people. Listen, if we want revival to come to America, it must first come to the church.","If it's going to come to the church, it must first come in the heart of the pastors and the spiritual leaders of the DE. If we're not preparing our hearts and asking God for a fresh move of his spirit in our life, you can rest assured it's not going to happen in the country. Now, there's a remnant of faithful pastors that are boldly declaring God's truth, living and upholding his principles and his purposes. And I hope that we here at Prestonwood, a spiritual leaders, I hope that we're in this room. But it is a general conclusion that you can look at the spiritual leadership of a nation and see whether or not that country is healthy or not.","And as a leader goes, so goes the people. Pastors and spiritual leadership, deacons, Bible fellowship, teachers and directors, as we go, so goes the church.","Dad's father's. As you go, so goes the home.","CEOs, business leaders, as you go, so goes your business.","As a nation. As our president and political leaders go, so goes the country.","The leader goes, so goes the people, and if we want America to be hild, it starts with God called men and women living out there calling and integrity and character and faithfulness, because if we don't, it starts a chain reaction that runs throughout society. Listen to our friend, Dr. Tony Evans. Who in an article just released yesterday morning in the Washington Post titled The Article, says this America's current violence can be traced to Christians failures. Listen to the article. Dr. Tony Evans writes, These recent spate of violence, like all of our worldly problems, have happened because Christians have failed to advance God's kingdom, to spread the faith and to do so in a loving, unified way. God must be the days of only pointing fingers at others to fix what they may never fix. Our nation's ills are not merely the result of corruption or racism. Although these are evil, our troubles can also be traced directly to ineffective Christians. One of the real tragedies today is that the church as a whole has not furthered God's light equity in love and principles in our land in order to be a positive influence and impact for good in the midst of darkness, fear and hate. He's stating exactly what Josia is, why are Christians failing to penetrate darkness and advance God's kingdom? Why does the church seem so impotent? And not further in God's light and equity and love, Hosea's says it's because the spiritual leaders are no longer being faithful to God. The spiritual leaders are not heralding truth. The spiritual leaders aren't leading the way. In fact, he says, the only thing they're doing versus five here in the nation of Israel is stumbling continuously. Do you see it? And because the spiritual leadership is stumbling, God says, I will destroy your mother. That is the nation of Israel.","So look and understand the massive implications.","For spiritual leadership to be walking with God. It's why it's so important that you as a church, pray. For the spiritual leaders of this church, not just this church, but.","Spiritual leaders all over America that we would stand in pulpits and we would preach God's word and we would lead congregations to be salt and light, to demonstrate God's love and justice and faithfulness, if we ignore God, if we're unfaithful to God, if we just teach what itching ears want to hear and we insulate ourselves in our holy huddle, staying away from engaging the culture at large, the result could just be the same as that as it was for Israel, where God says I will destroy the nation.","And so I read this and I wonder, is this what we're seeing played out today? We are paying the price.","Because the spiritual leadership has not and is not doing their job of proclaiming and living out what God's word clearly says that we're destroy there in the second part of verse five, it's an interesting word. It means to lay waste to.","To ruin, to cut off.","Is the picture of a violent disaster that creates utter destruction.","Wiping it out. So when we say. We need to return to the Lord. There's a sense of urgency that goes along with it.","Hosea, for God points the finger at the spiritual leaders, as a result, it's run through society and say, a Chapter five, he begins to blame national leaders. You see this here, this Opry's pay attention to the House of Israel. Give Erro House of the King. How he judges them both, he says judgment is for you.","And so what do we do?","I mean, we read in Chapter six this the takeaway.","We are to return to the Lord, we are to return to the Lord, we are to return to the Lord.","But herein lies the problem.","Because even when the nation of Israel wanted to return to the Lord, they didn't do it in a way that honored him. And so look at what happens in versus four and five their deeds. They don't permit them to return to their God for a spirit of whoredom is within them. And they know, not the Lord. The pride of Israel testifies to his face. A spirit of whoredom for the kids in the room.","Think cheating on a test, not being faithful, not being true. He says, you say you want to return to the Lord, but your deeds don't allow it in, your pride testifies to your face.","This is our problem. It's pride. Now, if revival is going to start, it starts in the pulpit with the spiritual leaders and then it starts in the church.","I mean, we can't.","Expect revival to come to America if it doesn't happen in our hearts, if it doesn't happen in our lives. So as Christians, this is a call to say, you know what, we've got a term from the pride of doing our own thing and going our own way, and we've got to humbly seek the face of God. More on that in a moment. But as a nation, as a people, if we have any hope of healing as a nation and as a people, we have to turn from our pride. It is testifying to our face. It is our pride that is separating our nation from God.","Pride testifies to our face, we don't need God. We're rich, we're wealthy, we're comfortable.","We don't need God, 20 million dollars in debt, we'll just keep spending, we don't need God. In our schools, nineteen sixty three, let's take prayer out of the schools, we don't need God there, we're only God and our pride testifies to our faith.","God, we don't need God to define and determine life, we get to make those choices and our pride testifies to our faith. We don't need God.","Freedom of religion, which is a right that we have as Americans to take our faith and what we learn here and know here and love here, use it in the marketplaces and businesses and schools where now we're saying we don't need freedom of religion, freedom of worship. You come and do what you want to do within the four walls of the church. But don't take it outside of there. We don't need God.","And in this hour, Pride is testifying to our base, what is at the root of this senseless shootings?","What is at the root of hatred and prejudice and racism?","Is it not pride testifying to our face? And so when tragedies like Thursday evening happen, we often hear where is God?","We need God.","But until we humble ourselves first as Christians, as a church and then as a nation, till we humble ourselves and return to him in a way that honors him, we will never find him. Look at four six, one of the scariest verses in the Bible with their flocks and herds, they shall go to seek the Lord.","Where is God? Let's find him. They shall go to seek the Lord, but they will not find him, for he has withdrawn from him.","That's what pride does. That's what going our own way does. God repellent. He knows our heart, he knows if we're just offering lip service. And pride and pretense is a stench in its nostrils, so much so that if we begin, if we don't turn returned to him in a way that honors him, look at verse 15 of chapter five. The first part, God says, I'll return again to my place. It's a picture of a lion who's gotten up to roar. And just returns to its den.","So how do we. Return in a way that honors God.","How do we return in a way that gets God's attention?","We have to implement Josia Chapter five, verses 15 through Josia, Chapter six, verse one, because until we do, there will be no awakening. There will be no revival. So this is what we are hoping for, this is what we're pleading for this morning, there's hope in this verse.","How do we return in a way that honors you, God, look at the second part of verse 15, we must acknowledge our guilt so God returns to his place until until we acknowledge our guilt, until we seek God's face and in our distress, earnestly seek him.","This is the recipe, this is the posture, this is what we must do if we want and move the spirit of God, if we want our country healed, this is what we must do, this type of returning to God where we acknowledge our sin and seek his face and earnestly seek after him this type of returning to God, he will never turn away. In fact, he will come running to us. It's the scriptural promise of Jeremiah twenty nine 13 that whoever seeks me and seeks me with their whole heart, he will find me. This is a seeking after God with our whole heart.","No one is confession. That's what we must do. He says, acknowledge your guilt.","It's time to confess our sins individually, corporately, and then we stand in the gap as Christians for our country. We must confess our sins first, John one nine. If we confess our sins, he is faithful. And just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, revival begins in our heart. It's been defined as nothing more, nothing less than a new obedience to God. And this obedience begins when we begin to confess not just our actions, but the inclinations of our heart. We get along with the Lord by the power of his Holy Spirit. We say, God, search me. Is there racism in my heart?","Is their prejudices, their hatred, Lord root it out.",{statementSentiment:"encouragingEmpathy",text:"God, do I care for my neighbor when I watch these images on the screen and I see them come across social media and I don't know them and I'm so far away from it and it doesn't affect me, God, is my heart not soft to your hurts in my mourning with those who mourn, weeping, with those who weep."},"We must confess our sin. I read a passage like this and I see where the Nehemiah is who want to rebuild the broken walls.","Where are the Daniels who want to stand in righteousness before unholy kings and say, I will not bow down?","Where are the Ezras who will take God's word and they will study it and they will meditated and they won't allow it to leave their mouth, chew on it, they long for it.","We must forsake our pride and confess our sense that once again, God turns and hears our cry. Secondly, consecration, he says, seek my face. That's an urgent call to serious prayer and holy living. We are to seek the face of God. Second, Chronical seven 14. If my people again, it starts with us. If my people will call on my name who are called by my name, will humble themselves, starts with humility and pray and seek my face consecration and turn from their wicked ways. I will hear from heaven and will forgive them and I will heal their land.","We must humble ourselves and seek his face. One of the action steps that Tony Evans calls for in his article regarding what can churches do in times like these? He says, we need to call for solemn assemblies where we gather together in prayer and fasting. We ask for God's manifest presence to emerge and our culture. You know what's beautiful this has been in the heart of our pastor is why he called for just a few weeks ago. When fall Wednesdays begin that we will gather together to pray with a solemn assembly. And when wed start in the fall will come in this worship center we're working right now and how that's going to relate to other programs that go on within the church. But we're calling the body together to pray and to fast and to ask God to move, not going to do it unless it starts in our heart. This is a result calling and crying out to God. God, I want to desire what you desire, want to hate what you hate. I want to love what you love. I'll go wherever you go. Now, consecration does not mean you have to have it all together. Listen, the invitation days you come just as you are.","It just comes with an honest heart. This has got I'm tired of going my own way, doing my own thing, here's the blank check. Fill it in. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. My yes is on the tape. That's consecration that's returning that God honors. Thirdly, and finally, commitment. We confess, we consecrate we separate ourselves where we we we live holy lives and then we commit to this, he says. In their distress, they earnestly, earnestly, earnestly seek me the personal relationship here in their distress.","This has been a distressing week. You know what we usually do in times of distress. If you're like me, you stress.","Are we get fearful?","Oh, we throw up our hands and say, man, this world's going in a different direction, there's no use and pray and there's no use in doing good deeds of no use and being salt like my I can't make a difference. So you just throw your hands up and you insulate yourself. You put your guard up. No one can be trusted.","Ansted godson's don't do that earnestly, seek me like the Sonus earnestly desire me like Jacob, who said I'm going to the prayer room and I'm not letting go God until you bless me, until you speak to me, until I meet with you. This is a returning that honors the Lord. That's why on the invitation of Hosea's six one, it's come, come, let us return together.","Come and Jesus puts a face on this invitation to come. How often do we see in the scriptures, Matthew. Eleven twenty eight. Come to me all you who are tired and have heavy burdens and Jesus said I'll give you revelation chapter twenty two. All who are thirsty, all who have thirst. Indeed to be quick come to me and I'll satisfy your thirst.",{statementSentiment:"theAnswerIsJesus",text:"Jesus is the ultimate answer. He's what we need. So he says Come, come to me."},"That's God's ultimate rescue plan because the people of Israel continued to rebel against God and rebelled against God, and they wouldn't come to him and say, if God says I'm coming to you in the person of Jesus Christ, and he came and he lived a perfect life and he died a sacrificial death on a cross shed his blood for you and I. And he raised from the dead, demonstrating that he has the power to forgive our sin and restore us to a right relationship with God. And if he can raise from the dead, he can heal America. And so we come to the Lord. We return to a way that honors him. Look at this. Let us return to the Lord. Let us this is corporate us together. This is a call for us together. Return to the Lord, for he has taught us a picture of a predator shedding shredding its prey with its claws that he may heal as he has struck us down, that he will bind us up.","After two days he will revive us, and on the third day he will raise us up. Listen, America may be knocking on death's door, but God can raise us up. He can raise us up in a moment.","His first speaking in light of the New Testament resurrection of Jesus, why, so that we could live before him. I read this and I say, Dear God, is this what you're doing?","Are you tearing us so that your loving hands can heal us like a surgeon? Are you breaking our bones so that you can set it and fix it and make it all better again? Are you striking us down so that you can bind us up? May it be. God may be.","And when we return to the Lord. In this way, look at the results, this is what we want.",{statementSentiment:"theAnswerIsJesus",text:"Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord we return to him. His going out is as assures the dawn and when we return, in a way that honors him through confession and consecration and commitment. He will come to us as the showers, as the spring rains that water the earth. This is what we want, a downpour of the presence of God. This is an awakening. This is a revival. Can who can heal America? The one who comes like the rain. And so we say, come, Lord Jesus, like the spring rains that water the earth rain your presence down in our hearts in this church and in the country that we love."}],D=["I believe this morning that the times that we are living in, God has perfectly prepared us for the trouble that we see, the pain in our nation, the hatred, the disappointment, the injustice, the violence. The morning, so we either bury the dead and move on or we rise up as the body of Christ and say we're here to make a difference. If, in fact, there are 300 plus million professing Christians in America, we can make a change.","I want you to open your heart today and prepare to hear from my heart and hopefully the heart of the father, what he has in mind I want to talk to you about. And there's no ego in this title, but it's taken totally from the word of God.","And I want to talk to you about how to stop the violence in America. God is concerned about violence. I don't know if you understand this or not, but that's what got the world flooded in the Old Testament. The Bible says that God looked upon the Earth and saw that it was only filled with violence. And he said, I'm going to drown at all and start over. God is concerned about violence.","Father, I pray that you be with us today for this word. I pray that you open our hearts, our eyes of understanding our ears to hear and send us out of this place as change agents in the earth.","Because for this hour, we came into the world in Jesus name.

And we were having a great time. And then these things begin to happen. And I actually had plans to come back down and fly through. I did a conference for Pastor Gordon last week in Seattle and then we went from there to Alaska. So I was coming back to Seattle, Las Vegas, Flagstaff was my flight pattern. And so when I was on the way from Seattle to Vegas, I just decided, I'm not going on to Flagstaff, I'm going to go to Dallas. I need to be in my city.","This is the city I love.

Dallas is a special place to God. Some of the greatest churches in the world are in Dallas, this being one of them, man."},"And when the enemy detects now this is true for you as individuals as well, when the enemy detects anointing on your life, then he targets you for destruction.","And so what was it, 1962?","Almost 50 years ago, President Kennedy was assassinated in the streets of Dallas. Why? Because the devil wants to mark a city of destiny with a smear of shame. And so now he's done it again with the senseless murder of five police officers and two civilians and others who hang in the balance and with their families and loved ones who sit at their bedside at Baylor Hospital or right where we said with Steven, I pray for them today that God give us healing and mercy and covering a man. I want to talk to you today from the word of God about how we can end the violence in America because we are on a dangerous path. No. One, I want you to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that there is us and them. When I say us and them, I'm not talking about the haves and the have nots. I'm not talking about the whites and the blacks.","I'm not talking about the upper echelon in the lower level. I'm talking about the kingdom of God and his light and the kingdom of darkness and those who do not understand there is a difference between us and them. And as long as there is the kingdom of God in the midst of darkness, it's like a cold front and the hot air from the Gulf meeting, that's where tornadic activity happens. So the kingdom of light is here to confront darkness, whatever form it takes. That is our calling."," Number two, Jesus said that we are called to be salt and light. Now, that doesn't mean as much to us as readily to be understood as it did in that day. But in that day, there was no refrigeration, no ice. And so everything had to be preserved that was going to be eaten later. And they primarily use salt or drying techniques for doing that. So salt was their major preservative. Please hear me without the kingdom of God. See, there are people in Dallas today that think the church is the problem in the enemy. The reality is, if it weren't for the people of God and his mighty church in the earth, we would already have descended into total destruction and chaos. It is the power of God through the church that holds back darkness. So we are seen with no salt in Jesus day. Any meat that was taken that you intended to feed your family with later would rot. And the same is true in the spirit today. Without the Kingdom of God holding back darkness and preserving the will of God in the Earth, society will rot at the core.","And secondly, he said, you are light lt is a Revealer you can't see without light, you stumble in the darkness without light.","Has your wife ever change the furniture on you?

And I'm going to teach you some Hebrew real quickly.","ECD has said has said is the word that they are attempting to translate adequately in English.","So they had to say in verse number six here, your goodness and your loving kindness or your tender mercy.

I know, but I want you to hear this because I'm not being dramatic. This may be the greatest concept of the attributes of who and what God is of any of them in the Bible. The word has said in the Old Testament, in Hebrew is written hundreds of times. This may be one of God's greatest attributes and one of them that he most wants us to have.","What is a has said, I said to a Jew, is an act of kindness given to a stranger, someone who's got a flat tire on the side of the road, someone who can't pay their bill because their credit card was turned down and you pay for their meal.

And I had that sense that I knew him, but I didn't know where from.","And and and I really knew that I probably didn't know him, but he felt familiar. Do you ever get that feeling like. I think I know them, but I don't know where from. And so I just stopped at their table and I said, how are you doing? And they said, we're doing good. And I said, I'm sorry. I just I loved your smile. And I I felt like I knew you. And he said, well, we've never been to this restaurant before. And I said, well, I've been a couple of times, I really like it. And so we talked for a minute and he said, well, this is my wife and I was. Twenty ninth wedding anniversary. We're celebrating tonight. And just out of my heart, I said, congratulations. That's wonderful. Would it be OK if I pay for your dinner? The waiter was right there. I said, put it on my tab. And they said, No, no, you don't have to do that. I said, no, please let me.","I didn't know these people. Tears came in this man's eyes.","And he said to me, I told him what I did, Noel. And he said to me, Pastor, I'm in law enforcement here in Las Vegas and I work with gangs. And there is so much trouble and fear and misgiving.","And you just made my day.","And I said, here's my joy.","So I sat down, finished our dinner, they were leaving before we were, and he came over and just sat down in my booth and scooted me over and said, my wife wants to take a picture of you and I.","Can I have your picture?","And I've got a friend that's a has said I don't know them, I just want to do something now I know we all want some deep revelation, but let me share something with you with the troubles we're seeing in the nation right now.

But if there are more than 300 million professing Christians that believe in Jesus in this nation, what if we today sent 300 million people out of churches all over America with a heart to look for an opportunity to do something for someone as an act of love, undeserved?","We change the world.",{statementSentiment:"encouragingEmpathy",text:"We don't listen enough disenfranchized people, oppressed people, poor people, struggling people, broken, people listening to them is a form of loving them."},"Sometimes you just have to listen, listen to their pain, listen to their experience, listen to their story.","We can do something better.","An interesting concept also that I love about has said is that there are many passages in the Bible that in God's mind, he ties has said to the morning the AM first thing in the morning he ties, has said.","And every morning together, for instance, you probably know the famous verse and lamentation chapter three, I think it's about verse 23 that says For your mercies are new every morning.

And what you did last week is not today's has said every morning has new mercy.","Now isn't it amazing that we can look at and read that verse and we always apply it to our own personal need for fresh mercy instead of applying it to the fact that there's somebody?","That God's going to lead me to.","But I can be their blessing and my Hishem from God is fresh this morning. You can't ever give enough of it away to beat God because he's going to make it for you fresh every morning.","So here's what I want to ask you as a part of this message today, would you make a silent vow in your heart to say, father, in my mourning, quiet time or devotion, I want to start my day with saying whatever the Fresh has said is for me today?","Let me be sensitive to that one that you want me to touch in to help, because he is an act of love undeserved, it's not somebody you see if somebody has to earn it.","Is it really love at all? You know, the levels at which we love are just not at the Christlike level yet, the apostle Paul and Peter and the early apostles were writing things like this, pray for those in authority, even your emperor and Rome. This was when they were under the unbelievable persecution and domination of Nero, who was the worst emperor of Rome ever had for Christian persecution. Impulse's pray for him. Pray for him.","I'm not going to pray for, you know, you pray for it, you pray for all those in authority, you know, if I apply this now, every time we see an unfortunate and unjust, a disappointing, a disgusting outpouring of some kind of authoritative violence against a citizen.

I mean, I'm a gun guy. I own guns. I think we should I think it's OK. But I don't know how you legislate this, but nobody with a heart full of hate ought to be allowed to own a gun. So let's put that on an al.","Before I sell you this, I don't care if you're a lawman or you're a street thug, do you have a heart full of hate? If you do, I'm not selling you this gun because guns have never hurt anybody. That didn't have a heart full of hate and a heart full of hate just makes a gun a more convenient way to do it quicker than what you would do over time if you have a heart full of hate.","Now, I'm not going to get into that discussion right now. We will do that because I like to say some things sometimes. I know if you've noticed that or not. And opinions are like elbows. All of us got at least two of them.","Let me give you some practical application about has said, listen to other people, groups listening is a form of loving, pray for has said opportunities every morning.","I'm not responsible for the Christians in the whole nation, but I am responsible to speak to this house and I challenge you in the name of Jesus, that if we would begin to go out of here looking for opportunities to love somebody, to do someone, an act of kindness or love, even undeserved, this is a study for another time. I'm out of time. But listen to this. The first time has said was ever used in the Bible. You know where it was early in the days of Genesis, God created his highest creation, Adam and Eve.","He had plans for them to be fruitful in the whole earth. They weren't even out of the garden yet and they had already fallen into total disobedience and sin. And what does the Bible say? The Bible says in the cool of the evening, as he always did, God pursued them in the garden. He knew they were feeling bad and shameful and trying to cover themselves with fig leaves and all that. And what did God do? God slaughtered animals, made firs to cover them and pursued them until he found them and clothed them. And that's the first place in the Bible has said is used, has said is an act of love that is deserved. Has said is an act of love that is an earned and let me give you one more word of instruction and caution. Please hear this.","If we start as a larger church like we are, if we fall into the dangerous trap of the church, having to build a program and a committee and a department and an office, every time we talk about doing anything to help the community, then that's a black hole that we can never satisfy because we're going to be adding more staff and having more meetings than we are loving people. There was a lady one time I came to the church. This was years ago and our receptionist at that time was over here and she was just about in tears.","And I said, what's the matter? And she put to let me put you on, hold them and put it on hold to this lady is extremely irate and she's hurt my feelings. And I said, let me talk to her.","So I said, Yes, ma'am, what is it?","She said, I go to your church, she said, and I met a family that doesn't have any food.","And I want your church to take them some groceries. And I said, OK, you're part of our church, I am. I said, well, where did you meet these people? She told me. I said, well, let me kind you ask it kindly ask you something. Do you have a car? I do. Do you know where a grocery store is located?","I do.","Then do you have enough money to buy a sack of groceries for someone that is in need? Because maybe that was the reason God let you find them with that need.","And and here's the thing I said, if you feel like that loving someone who is hungry is satisfied by you calling the church and chewing us out because we haven't run to give them a sack of groceries, then we'll never be the church.","I said, Dear sister, you are the church. We can't build a program for every need we have to leave out of here by the thousands today. Loving people meeting needs waking up with fresh Hassad every morning.","So let me finish with this.

I don't have a life outside of you.","And if we have to give our lives in the line of duty of loving people, then so be it is our ticket to heaven. Because my highest goal in life, and sometimes you have to count this cost and I'm going to end with this because it's a really important point.","I've counted this cost because to be honest with you, I'm in a stage of my life where a beautiful new generation is taking over more all the time. And I've got the right. And if I can say so without sounding egotistical, I've earned it. For more than 40 years of faithful pastoral ministry, I can slow down and I could live an easy life right now and I could choose to just keep my mouth shut and let stuff happen.","But that's not me, because my highest priority. Is not to save my own life.","And God's highest priority for me is not to live a life of ease and comfort. Jesus said it this way and it doesn't make enough sense in the English translation. I'll break it down for you. He said, if you save your life, you'll lose it if you lose your life. For my sake in the gospel, you'll find it. That's the way it reads in English. It loses something there. Because in the original, here's what Jesus said.","If you seek only to save your lower form of human life, you will lose the higher God life that I've called you, too.","But if you will lose or give up your lower form of life, you will find the higher form of life.
